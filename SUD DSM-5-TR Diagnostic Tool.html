Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after reducing heavy, prolonged intake.  To avoid withdrawal, individuals may continue drinking despite adverse consequences.  Intense craving for alcohol can make it difficult to think of anything else.  The disorder can lead to neglect of major responsibilities at school, work, or home ; use in hazardous situations ; and continued use despite knowing it causes physical or psychological problems. </div></div><div class="mb-6 prose max-w-none"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Associated Features</h3><div class="text-gray-700">This disorder is often associated with problems related to other substances like cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and sedatives.  Symptoms of conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes precede it.  Repeated high-dose intake can affect nearly every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specific health issues include gastritis, ulcers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, increased cancer rates, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy.  Neurological effects can include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), and degenerative changes.  The disorder is also a significant contributor to suicide risk. </div></div><div class="mb-6 prose max-w-none"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Prevalence</h3><div class="text-gray-700">In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among adults is 29.1% (8.6% mild, 6.6% moderate, 13.9% severe).  Australian lifetime prevalence is 31.0%.  U.S. rates are higher in men (36.0%) than women (22.7%).  For DSM-IV criteria, the 12-month prevalence was 4.6% for ages 12-17, 16.2% for ages 18-29, and 1.5% for those 65 and older.

Alcohol use disorder typically has an onset in the late teens or early to mid-20s.  The majority of individuals who develop the disorder do so by their late 30s.  The course is variable, characterized by periods of remission and relapse.  A decision to stop drinking is often followed by abstinence, but a return to drinking is highly likely to escalate.  Late-onset of the disorder (after age 40) occurs in about 10% of cases.  Older adults are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol due to age-related physical changes. </div></div><div class="mb-6 prose max-w-none"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Risk and Prognostic Factors</h3><div class="text-gray-700">Environmental risk factors include poverty, discrimination, unemployment, cultural attitudes, alcohol availability, and stress levels.

        "Diagnostic Features": "Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical symptoms, such as withdrawal, tolerance, and craving.  Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after reducing heavy, prolonged intake.  To avoid withdrawal, individuals may continue drinking despite adverse consequences.  Intense craving for alcohol can make it difficult to think of anything else.  The disorder can lead to neglect of major responsibilities at school, work, or home ; use in hazardous situations ; and continued use despite knowing it causes physical or psychological problems. ",
        "Associated Features": "This disorder is often associated with problems related to other substances like cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and sedatives.  Symptoms of conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes precede it.  Repeated high-dose intake can affect nearly every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specific health issues include gastritis, ulcers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, increased cancer rates, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy.  Neurological effects can include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), and degenerative changes.  The disorder is also a significant contributor to suicide risk. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among adults is 29.1% (8.6% mild, 6.6% moderate, 13.9% severe).  Australian lifetime prevalence is 31.0%.  U.S. rates are higher in men (36.0%) than women (22.7%).

These changes are accompanied by signs of impaired functioning such as slurred speech or incoordination, and can result in a life-threatening coma if severe.  The symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition or mental disorder.  Incoordination can impair driving and cause accidents.  Alcohol use can be confirmed by smell, self-report, or toxicology analyses. ",
        "Associated Features": "Intoxication symptoms are often more intense when blood alcohol levels are rising.  Early in a session, stimulating effects like talkativeness may occur, while later, depressant and cognitive impairment effects emerge as levels fall.  Amnesia for events during intoxication ('blackouts') can happen at high blood alcohol levels.  At very high blood alcohol levels (>300-400 mg/dL), intoxication can be fatal in nontolerant individuals.  Intoxication is a major contributor to interpersonal violence and suicidal behavior. ",
        "Prevalence": "A large majority of alcohol consumers have likely been intoxicated at some point.  In 2018, 17.5% of U.S. 12th graders reported being drunk in the prior 30 days.  The 12-month prevalence of high-risk drinking varies by ethnoracial group, from 7.2% for Asians and Pacific Islanders to 17.4% for Native Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "Intoxication is an episode lasting several hours.  The average age of first intoxication in the U.S. is about 15, with prevalence peaking between 18-25 years.  Earlier onset of regular intoxication predicts a greater likelihood of developing alcohol use disorder. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Personality traits like sensation-seeking and impulsivity increase risk.  Environmental factors include having heavy-drinking peers and using alcohol to cope with stress. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cultural acceptance of drunkenness varies, with some college groups encouraging it and some religious groups discouraging it. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Historically, intoxication was more tolerated in men, but this gender gap may be narrowing.  Women are generally less tolerant of the same amount of alcohol than men. ",

        "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Intoxication": "Intoxication contributed to over 95,000 deaths annually in the U.S. from 2011-2015.  It also leads to huge costs from drunk driving, lost productivity, arguments, and fights. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is a characteristic withdrawal syndrome after abruptly stopping or reducing prolonged daily caffeine intake.  The syndrome requires three or more symptoms, with headache being the hallmark feature.  Other symptoms include fatigue, depressed mood, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.  The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment.  Because caffeine is in many products, individuals may be unaware of their physical dependence and misattribute withdrawal symptoms to other causes. ",
        "Associated Features": "Abstinence can impair behavioral and cognitive performance, increase total sleep time, and alter EEG readings.  Decreased motivation and sociability are also reported. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is unclear, but withdrawal is common.  Approximately 50% of coffee drinkers experience a headache upon abstinence.  In those trying to quit, over 70% report at least one withdrawal symptom. ",
        "Development and Course": "Symptoms typically start 12-24 hours after the last dose, peak at 1-2 days, and can last from 2-9 days, though headaches may persist longer.  The syndrome can occur even after cessation of relatively low daily doses (100 mg).  Gradual reduction of caffeine can decrease withdrawal severity. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Heavy caffeine use is seen among individuals with other mental disorders, who may be at higher risk for withdrawal.  Unavailability of caffeine is an environmental risk factor.  Genetic factors also appear to increase vulnerability. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Habitual users who fast for religious reasons may be at increased risk. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Caffeine metabolism is slower in women who use oral contraceptives and during the later stages of pregnancy, which may diminish or lengthen withdrawal symptoms. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Caffeine Withdrawal": "Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to extreme, sometimes causing functional impairment.  Reported impairments include being unable to work or care for children, and canceling social events.  The headaches can be severe. "

Also common are major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and personality disorders.  Among adolescents, it often co-occurs with conduct disorder and ADHD.  Cannabis use is consistently associated with an increased risk for psychosis.  Medical comorbidities include cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and respiratory disorders. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder includes problems associated with substances from the cannabis plant and synthetic cannabinoids, where THC is the primary psychoactive component.  Cannabis is used in many forms, including smoking, vaping, dabbing, and edibles, with widely varying potency.  The disorder is defined by a cluster of 11 behavioral and physical symptoms leading to impairment, including withdrawal, tolerance, craving, and hazardous use.  Regular users develop tolerance, and cessation can lead to a withdrawal syndrome.  Continued use despite negative impacts on relationships or activities is a key marker of a severe disorder. ",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals often use cannabis to cope with mood, insomnia, or pain.  Chronic use can produce a lack of motivation resembling persistent depressive disorder.  Physical signs can include red eyes, cannabis odor, yellowed fingertips, and chronic cough. ",
        "Prevalence": "Past-year prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis use disorder in the U.S. is 2.7%-3.1% for youth and 1.5%-2.9% for adults.  For DSM-5, 12-month prevalence is about 2.5% in adults.  Prevalence is highest among ages 18-29 (6.9%).  Rates are higher in men than women.  Among ethnoracial groups, rates are highest in American Indians/Alaska Natives and African Americans.  Only 7%-8% of adults with the disorder receive treatment. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset is most common in adolescence or young adulthood.  The disorder generally develops over an extended period, though progression may be faster in adolescents with conduct problems.  Early onset (before age 15) is a robust predictor of developing this and other substance use disorders.  Among adults, the disorder often involves well-established patterns of daily use. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risk factors include a history of conduct disorder and other externalizing or internalizing disorders.  Environmental risks include unstable family situations, childhood abuse, low socioeconomic status, and ease of availability.  Living in a U.S. state with legal recreational marijuana increases the risk for adults.  Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cannabis is one of the world's most commonly used psychoactive substances, with use influenced by local culture, religion, and social practices. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women may report more severe withdrawal symptoms than men, potentially leading to a faster transition to the disorder (telescoping).  In 2016-2017, 7.0% of pregnant women in a U.S. survey reported past-month cannabis use. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Urine tests for the metabolite THCCOOH can detect recent use but often remain positive for weeks in frequent users, limiting their utility.  Tests for cannabinoids in blood or oral fluids are in development. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Cannabis use disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, even after adjusting for comorbidities.  Chronic cannabis use, but not acute use, is associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder": "Functional consequences are part of the diagnostic criteria.  Cognitive function, particularly executive function, may become compromised in a dose-dependent manner.  Cannabis use impairs driving ability and has been linked to an amotivational syndrome, social relationship problems, and poorer life satisfaction. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This category covers a diverse group of substances including phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline, MDMA/ecstasy), indoleamines (e.g., psilocybin, DMT), and ergolines (e.g., LSD).  These substances are usually taken orally, but some can be smoked or injected.  Duration of effects varies widely.  Tolerance develops with repeated use.  Ecstasy users have a higher risk of developing this disorder than users of other hallucinogens.  A clinically significant withdrawal syndrome has not been consistently documented, so it is not a diagnostic criterion, though some evidence exists for withdrawal from MDMA. ",
        "Associated Features": "The characteristic symptom features of use of some hallucinogens, like the frightening visual hallucinations of LSD, can aid in diagnosis when toxicology is unavailable. ",
        "Prevalence": "This disorder is rare, with a 12-month prevalence of about 0.1% in the U.S. population age 12 and older.  The rate is highest among those aged 18-25 (0.4%).  However, prevalence is much higher in clinical samples and among heavy users. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is concentrated in young adults, with most cases occurring in individuals aged 18-29. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include high sensation-seeking.  Environmental risks in the U.S. include higher income, lower education, being unmarried, and living in urban areas.  Early onset of use is also a risk factor.  Genetic factors contribute an estimated 26% to 79% of the total variance in risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Some hallucinogens, like peyote and ayahuasca, are used in established religious or spiritual practices and should be considered within that cultural context. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Among U.S. adolescents, boys have higher rates of hallucinogen use than girls.  Among adults with the disorder, 60% are men.  Women may experience greater subjective effects from MDMA. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Laboratory testing can be useful, but some substances like LSD are so potent that they may not be detected by typical toxicology screens. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder": "Adverse effects include hyperthermia, cardiac issues, seizures, and other serious medical complications.  There is evidence for persisting neurotoxic effects from MDMA/ecstasy use, including memory impairment and serotonin system dysfunction. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder involves problematic use of volatile hydrocarbons found in glues, fuels, paints, and other compounds.  The specific substance should be named if possible.  Features include recurrent use despite serious problems, failure to fulfill major obligations, continued use despite social problems, and use in hazardous situations.  Tolerance is reported by about 10% of users.  A clinically significant withdrawal syndrome has not been established, so it is not a diagnostic criterion, although symptoms may occur. ",
        "Associated Features": "The diagnosis is supported by recurring intoxication episodes with negative standard drug screens, possession of inhalants, a 'glue-sniffer's rash' around the nose or mouth, and association with other users.  The disorder can be associated with serious medical complications like brain white matter pathology. ",
        "Prevalence": "Past 12-month prevalence in the U.S. is 0.1% for youth (ages 12-17) and 0.04% for adults.  Among youth, prevalence is highest among non-Hispanic Whites and those reporting more than one racialized identity. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is most common in adolescents and young adults and usually remits by early adulthood.  Calls to poison control for intentional abuse peak at age 14.  Adult-onset cases are associated with earlier first use and use of multiple inhalants. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include sensation seeking and impulsivity.  Environmental risks include the wide availability of inhalants and a history of childhood maltreatment or trauma.  Genetic and physiological risk is linked to behavioral disinhibition, a highly heritable trait. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Some isolated Indigenous communities and homeless children in low-income countries have a high prevalence of inhalant problems. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is rare in adult women, though prevalence is similar among adolescent boys and girls. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Biological testing for inhalants is generally impractical due to expense and technical issues. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "In the U.S., inhalant use and the disorder are associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in individuals with comorbid anxiety, depression, and trauma histories. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Inhalant Use Disorder": "Use can be fatal from anoxia, cardiac arrhythmia ('sudden sniffing death'), or accidents.  It impairs neurobehavioral function and causes various neurological and medical problems.  Long-term users are at increased risk for infections like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. "

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder involves problematic use of natural opioids (morphine), semisynthetics (heroin, oxycodone), and synthetics (fentanyl, methadone).  It consists of compulsive, prolonged self-administration for non-medical purposes or in excess of prescribed amounts.  Most individuals with the disorder have tolerance and experience withdrawal upon cessation.  Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (craving) contribute to relapse and persist long after withdrawal.  Daily activities are often planned around obtaining and using opioids.  Prescription opioids may be obtained illicitly, and healthcare professionals may divert drugs for their own use. ",
        "Associated Features": "Opioid overdose, characterized by unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils, can be fatal and has increased exponentially in the U.S. since 1999.  The disorder can be associated with drug-related crimes.  Marital difficulties and unemployment are also common. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of prescription opioid use disorder among U.S. adults is 0.6%-0.9%, while heroin use disorder is 0.1%-0.3%.  Rates are higher among men, young adults, and those with lower income or education.  Prevalence varies by ethnoracial group, with higher rates in Native Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is most commonly first observed in the late teens or early 20s.  Once established, the disorder can be chronic, continuing for many years with only brief periods of abstinence for some. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Risk factors include comorbid substance use disorders, externalizing traits like impulsivity, and social/environmental factors.  There is a strong genetic contribution to risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "While historically associated with socially oppressed groups, the disorder has become more common among White individuals, suggesting social factors and availability impact prevalence.  The diagnostic criteria perform equally well across ethnoracial groups. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women are more likely to initiate use in response to abuse or violence and may progress to a use disorder more quickly than men ('telescoping'). ",

        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "The disorder is associated with a heightened risk for suicide attempts and death.  Repeated intoxication or withdrawal can induce severe, temporary depressions that lead to suicide.  Opioid use disorder elevates suicide mortality risk, especially in women. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder": "Physiological consequences include dry mouth, severe constipation, and impaired vision.  Injection use leads to sclerosed veins ('tracks'), cellulitis, and abscesses.  The risk of infections like tetanus, botulism, endocarditis, hepatitis C, and HIV is high.  Chronic use can lead to hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity).  The mortality rate is 6-20 times greater than in the general population, primarily due to overdose, accidents, and medical complications. "

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This class includes benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related drugs.  These brain depressants can produce disorders similar to those from alcohol.  The disorder can arise from both prescribed and illicitly obtained substances.  Craving is a typical feature.  Misuse often occurs with other substances, such as using benzodiazepines to 'come down' from stimulants.  The disorder can lead to failure to fulfill major role obligations and continued use despite social or interpersonal problems.  Significant tolerance and withdrawal can develop.  However, tolerance and withdrawal that occur during appropriate medical use do not count toward the diagnosis unless other criteria are met. ",
        "Associated Features": "Often associated with other substance use disorders.  With repeated use, tolerance develops to sedative effects, but tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly, increasing the risk of fatal respiratory depression with dose escalation.  Intense intoxication can lead to severe, temporary depression and suicide attempts. ",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of the DSM-IV disorder in the U.S. is about 0.3% for both adolescents and adults.  Prevalence is highest among those aged 18-29 (0.5%).  Rates do not consistently vary by gender in the U.S., but some international studies show higher rates in women. ",
        "Development and Course": "One common course involves escalation of use in teens or young adults, often alongside other substance use disorders.  Another course begins with a legitimate prescription, followed by dose escalation due to tolerance or perceived need.  Onset is typically in adolescence or early adulthood, with risk for misuse decreasing after age 30.  However, older individuals are more susceptible to side effects like cognitive impairment and falls. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include impulsivity and novelty-seeking.  Environmental risks relate to the availability of the drugs through prescriptions.  Genetic factors play an important role.  Early onset of use is associated with a greater likelihood of developing the disorder. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prescription patterns vary across countries, which may affect prevalence.  In the U.S., benzodiazepine use is more frequently reported by non-Latinx Whites, but the risk of developing the disorder may be higher in other groups like African Americans once use is initiated. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "There appear to be no gender differences in the prevalence of the disorder. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Most of these substances can be identified in urine or blood tests.  Urine tests may remain positive for up to a week for long-acting substances. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "U.S. epidemiological studies show an association between hypnotics and suicide, but it is unclear if this is due to underlying conditions like depression and insomnia, which are also suicide risk factors. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder": "Consequences are similar to alcohol use disorder, with potential for accidents, interpersonal difficulties, and work/school impairment.  Overdoses can be lethal, especially when mixed with other depressants like alcohol or opioids.  Intravenous use carries risks of infections like hepatitis and HIV. "

      "differential_diagnosis": "Intoxication with phencyclidine or 'bath salts'; stimulant intoxication, withdrawal, and induced mental disorders; and independent mental disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. ",
      "comorbidity": "Stimulant-related disorders often co-occur with other substance use disorders, particularly those involving sedatives.  They may also be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and gambling disorder.  Cardiopulmonary problems are often present in individuals seeking treatment. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This class includes amphetamine-type substances (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate) and cocaine.  The disorder can develop rapidly, sometimes within a week of exposure.  Tolerance occurs with repeated use, and withdrawal symptoms (dysphoria, fatigue, unpleasant dreams) can enhance craving.  Amphetamine-type substances are longer-acting than cocaine.  High-dose use can lead to aggressive behavior, intense anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychotic episodes.  Withdrawal from stimulants can cause temporary but intense depressive symptoms. ",
        "Associated Features": "When injected or smoked, stimulants produce an instant feeling of well-being and euphoria.  Chronic use can lead to chaotic behavior, social isolation, and aggression.  Intoxication may present with rambling speech, paranoia, and tactile hallucinations.  Withdrawal is associated with depression, suicidal thoughts, anhedonia, and irritability.  These mental disturbances usually resolve within hours to days but can persist for a month. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the U.S., the 12-month prevalence of amphetamine-type substance use disorder is 0.4%, and for cocaine use disorder, it is also 0.4%.  Rates are highest among individuals aged 18-25.  Rates are higher for men than women for both substance types. ",
        "Development and Course": "Use patterns can be chronic or episodic, with binges of continuous high-dose use over hours or days.  Smoking and intravenous use are associated with a more rapid progression to a severe use disorder.  Some individuals begin use to control weight or improve performance. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder.  Environmental risks include prenatal cocaine exposure and exposure to community violence or childhood mistreatment.  Men who have sex with men are at higher risk for methamphetamine use. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence and admission rates for treatment vary among ethnoracial groups in the U.S., which may reflect differential access to care, criminalization, and other social factors. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women with cocaine use disorder more frequently have comorbid depression and PTSD.  Gonadal hormones may affect responses to cocaine, with higher progesterone levels in women being associated with lower craving. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine for 1-3 days (up to 7-12 days in heavy users).  Amphetamine-type substances can be detected for 1-4 days.  Hair samples can detect use for up to 90 days. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Regular amphetamine use is associated with increased suicide mortality.  Cocaine use disorder is linked to higher rates of suicidal thoughts.  Both cocaine and amphetamine use disorders were associated with increased suicide deaths in a study of U.S. veterans. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Stimulant Use Disorder": "Medical conditions vary by route of administration. 'Snorting' can damage the nasal mucosa, smoking can cause respiratory problems, and injecting carries risks of HIV and hepatitis.  Weight loss and malnutrition are common.  Cardiac events like myocardial infarction and stroke can occur even in young, healthy individuals.  Neurocognitive impairment is common, and chronic use can cause neurotoxicity.  'Meth mouth' involves severe dental problems. "

It also increases perinatal problems like low birth weight.  Psychiatric comorbidities are common, especially with alcohol and other substance use disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and ADHD.  Individuals with a psychiatric disorder are three times more likely to have tobacco use disorder. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder can develop with use of all forms of tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes) and prescription nicotine.  The addictive potential is associated with the rapidity of nicotine delivery (smoked > oral > transdermal).  Tolerance is shown by the disappearance of nausea after initial use and the more intense effect of the first use of the day.  Cessation produces a clear withdrawal syndrome, and many use tobacco to relieve or avoid these symptoms.  The criteria for time spent obtaining the substance or failure to fulfill role obligations are less commonly endorsed for tobacco than for other substances due to its legal and accessible nature. ",
        "Associated Features": "Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, smoking daily, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with the disorder.  Serious medical conditions are common, as are symptoms like coughing and accelerated skin aging. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the U.S., 19% of adults used a tobacco product in the last year.  The 12-month prevalence of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder was 20% among U.S. adults, with rates varying significantly by ethnoracial group (from 11.2% in Asian Americans to 29.6% in Native Americans).  Prevalence is higher among men and those with lower income or education.  The prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50%. ",
        "Development and Course": "About 20% of U.S. high school seniors have tried cigarettes, with most daily users starting by that age.  Initiation after age 21 is rare.  Addiction can begin soon after initial use, but fulfilling full criteria for the disorder usually takes several years. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include externalizing personality traits.  Having other psychiatric disorders like ADHD, depression, or anxiety increases the risk.  Environmental risks include low income and low educational levels.  Genetic factors contribute about 50% of the heritability. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence varies greatly by geographic region, from 4.7% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 24.2% in Eastern Europe.  Higher prevalence is associated with exposure to racism and ethnic discrimination. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The ratio of male to female smokers in the U.S. is about 1.4:1.  Negative reinforcement (smoking to relieve negative affect) may be a stronger motivator in women.  Pregnant females smoke at a lower rate but relapse quickly after delivery. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Biomarkers like carbon monoxide in breath and cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine can measure use but are only weakly associated with the disorder itself. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Past-year cigarette use is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Tobacco use disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicide, even after adjusting for covariates. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder": "Half of smokers who do not quit will die early from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in more than one-half of tobacco users.  Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. "
