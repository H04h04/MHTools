A handful of Mental Health tools that I use for my job as a psychotherapist.

I ran the complete DSM-5-TR through Google Gemini to create the JSON file.  I have reviewed it for structural consistency, but it is a massive file and needs additional review to ensure that it is complete.  Community support in this area will be beneficial.
