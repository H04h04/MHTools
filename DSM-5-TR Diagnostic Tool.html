Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and standardized testing. Intellectual functioning (Criterion A) involves reasoning, problem solving, etc., and is typically measured with IQ tests, with scores around two standard deviations below the mean (approx. 65-75). Adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refers to how a person meets community standards in conceptual, social, and practical domains.</div></div><div class="mb-6 prose max-w-none"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Associated Features</h3><div class="text-gray-700">Difficulties with social judgment, risk assessment, and self-management. Gullibility is often a feature, leading to risk of exploitation and victimization.

For school-age children and adults, there are difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, or money, with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-related expectations. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning, strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-term memory, as well as functional use of academic skills (e.g., reading, money management), are impaired. There is a somewhat concrete approach to problems and solutions compared with age-mates.",

For example, there may be difficulty in accurately perceiving peers' social cues. Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in age-appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situations. There is limited understanding of risk in social situations; social judgment is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others (gullibility).",
                "Practical Domain": "The individual may function age-appropriately in personal care. Individuals need some support with complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In adulthood, supports typically involve grocery shopping, transportation, home and child-care organizing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and money management. Recreational skills resemble those of age-mates, although judgment related to well-being and organization around recreation requires support. In adulthood, competitive employment is often seen in jobs that do not emphasize conceptual skills. Individuals generally need support to make health care decisions and legal decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation competently. Support is typically needed to raise a family."

For school-age children, progress in reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and money occurs slowly across the school years and is markedly limited compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use of academic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-to-day life, and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.",
                "Social Domain": "The individual shows marked differences from peers in social and communicative behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for social communication but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for relationships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social judgment and decision-making abilities are limited, and caretakers must assist the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communicative support is needed in work settings for success.",
                "Practical Domain": "The individual can care for personal needs involving eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an adult, although an extended period of teaching and time is needed for the individual to become independent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be achieved by adulthood, although an extended period of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports will typically occur for adult-level performance. Independent employment in jobs that require limited conceptual and communication skills can be achieved, but considerable support from coworkers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage social expectations, job complexities, and ancillary responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, health benefits, and money management. A variety of recreational skills can be developed. These typically require additional supports and learning opportunities over an extended period of time.

Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and relationships are key. Repetitive behaviors can include motor stereotypies, insistence on sameness, fixated interests, and sensory sensitivities.",

        "Development and Course": "Symptoms are typically recognized during the second year of life (12-24 months). It is not a degenerative disorder; learning and compensation continue throughout life. Symptoms are often most marked in early childhood.",

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The defining feature of dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession (Criterion A). The overtness or covertness of these personality states varies as a function of psychological motivation, current level of stress, cultural context, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional resilience, among other factors. Sustained periods of identity confusion/alteration may occur when psychosocial pressures are severe and/or prolonged. In those cases of dissociative identity disorder that present as the individual being possessed by external identities (e.g., spirits, demons) (possession-form dissociative identity disorder), and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alternate identities are readily observable. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder do not overtly display, or only subtly display, their discontinuity of identity, and only a minority present to clinical attention with discernible alternation of identities. The elaboration of dissociative personality states with different names, wardrobes, hairstyles, handwritings, accents, and so forth, occurs in only a minority of individuals with the non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder and is not essential to diagnosis. In those cases where alternate personality states cannot be directly observed, the presence of distinct personality states can be identified by sudden alterations or discontinuities in the individual's sense of self and sense of agency (Criterion A), and recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B).\n\nCriterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any aspect of an individual's functioning. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their own speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (i.e., impaired sense of self and impaired sense of agency). These individuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child's voice, voices commenting on the individual's thoughts or behavior, persecutory voices and command hallucinations). In some cases, hearing voices is specifically denied, but the individual reports multiple, perplexing, independent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report hallucinations in all sensory modalities: auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory. Strong emotions, impulses, thoughts, and even speech or other actions may suddenly materialize, without a sense of personal ownership or control (i.e., lack of sense of agency). Conversely, thoughts and emotions may unexpectedly vanish, and speech and actions are abruptly inhibited. These experiences are frequently reported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences (e.g., about food, activities, gender identity) may suddenly shift. Individuals may report that their bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, the opposite gender, different ages simultaneously). Alterations in sense of self and agency may be accompanied by a feeling that attitudes, emotions, and behaviors even the individual's own body-are 'not mine' or are 'not under my control.' Although most Criterion A symptoms are subjective, these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior may be witnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. In most individuals with dissociative identity disorder, switching/shifting of states is subtle and may occur with only subtle changes in overt presentation. State switching may be more overt in the possession form of dissociative identity disorder. In general, the individual with dissociative identity disorder experiences himself or herself as multiple, simultaneously overlapping and interfering states.\n\nDissociative amnesia (Criterion B) manifests in several major domains: 1) gaps in any aspect of autobiographical memory (e.g., important life events like getting married or giving birth, lack of recall of all school experiences before high school); 2) lapses in memory of recent events or well-learned skills (e.g., how to do one's job, use a computer, cook or drive); and 3) discovery of possessions that the individual has no recollection of ever owning (e.g., clothing, weapons, tools, writings or drawings that he or she must have created). Dissociative fugues, with amnesia for travel, are common. Individuals may report suddenly finding themselves in another city, at work, or even at home: in the closet, under the bed, or running out of the house. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity disorder is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; it can involve everyday events as well. Individuals may report major gaps in ongoing memory (e.g., experiencing 'time loss,' 'blackouts,' or 'coming to' in the midst of doing something). Dissociative amnesia may be apparent to others (e.g., the individual does not recall something others witnessed that he or she did or said, cannot remember his or her own name, or may fail to recognize spouse, children, or close friends). Minimization or rationalization of amnesia is common.\n\nPossession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest behaviorally as if a 'spirit,' supernatural being, or outside person has taken control, with the individual speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For example, an individual's behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been replaced by the 'ghost' of a girl who died by suicide in the same community years before, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative identity disorder present recurrently, are unwanted and involuntary, and cause clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion C). However, the majority of possession states that occur around the world are usually part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice and therefore do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disorder (Criterion D).",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, or another common symptom. Nonepileptic seizures and other functional neurological symptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, especially in some non-Western settings. Some individuals, especially in Western settings, may present with apparently refractory neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, or symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia, or other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder report dissociative flashbacks during which they experience a sensory reliving of a previous event as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial or complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback, and a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder typically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adulthood. Other overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long, painful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Nonsuicidal self-injury is frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels of hypnotizability and dissociative symptoms compared with other clinical groups and healthy control subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.\n\nAmong personality features, avoidant personality features most often rate highest in individuals with dissociative identity disorder, and some individuals with dissociative identity disorder are so avoidant that they prefer to be alone. When decompensated, some individuals with dissociative identity disorder display features of borderline personality disorder (i.e., self-destructive high-risk behaviors, and mood instability). Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder display attachment problems but typically do not exhibit frantic activity to avoid being abandoned. Some have stable long-term relationships, albeit frequently dysfunctional and/or abusive ones, from which they may have difficulty extricating themselves. Obsessional personality features are common in dissociative identity disorder, more so than histrionic personality features. A subgroup of individuals with dissociative identity disorder have narcissistic and/or antisocial personality features.",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults in a small U.S. community study was 1.5%. Lifetime prevalence of dissociative identity disorder was 1.1% in a representative sample of community-based women in mid-eastern Turkey.",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder may first manifest at almost any age from early childhood to late life. Children usually do not present with identity shifting, instead presenting primarily with independently acting, imaginary companions, or as personified 'mood' states (Criterion A phenomena). Dissociation in children may generate problems with memory, concentration, and attachment, and may be associated with traumatic play. In adolescents, dissociative identity disorder commonly comes to clinical attention because of externalizing symptoms, suicidal/self-destructive behavior, or rapid behavioral shifts often ascribed to other disorders such as attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder or childhood bipolar disorder. Some children with dissociative identity disorder can also be quite aggressive and irritable. Older individuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with symptoms that appear to be late-life mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive disorders attributable to dissociative amnesia. Overt identity alteration/confusion may be triggered by many factors, such as later traumatic experiences (e.g., sexual assault), or even seemingly inconsequential stressors, like a minor motor vehicle accident. The experience of other major or cumulative life stressors may also worsen symptoms, including life events such as the individual's children reaching the same age at which the individual was significantly abused or traumatized. The death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, the individual's abuser(s) is another example of an event that may worsen symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are at high risk for adult interpersonal trauma such as rape, intimate partner violence, and sexual exploitation, including ongoing incestuous abuse into adulthood, as well as adult trafficking.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental. In the context of family and attachment pathology, early life trauma (e.g., neglect and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, usually before ages 5-6 years) represents a risk factor for dissociative identity disorder. In studies from diverse geographic regions, about 90% of the individuals with the disorder report multiple types of early neglect and childhood abuse, often extending into late adolescence. Some individuals report that maltreatment primarily occurred outside the family, in school, church, and/or neighborhoods, including being bullied severely. Other forms of repeated early-life traumatic experiences include multiple, painful childhood medical and surgical procedures; war; terrorism; or being trafficked beginning in childhood. Onset has also been described after prolonged and often transgenerational exposure to dysfunctional family dynamics (e.g., overcontrolling parenting, insecure attachment, emotional abuse) in the absence of clear neglect or sexual or physical abuse.\n\nGenetic and physiological. Twin studies suggest that genetics account for around 45%-50% of the interindividual variance in dissociative symptoms, with nonshared, stressful, and traumatic environmental experiences accounting for most of the additional variance. Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity disorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala.\n\nCourse modifiers. Ongoing sexual, physical, and emotional trauma often leads to significant difficulties in later functioning. Poorer outcome in adults is commonly related to severe psychosocial stressors, revictimization, ongoing sexual or physical abuse or exploitation, intimate partner violence, refractory substance use, eating disorders, severe medical illness, enmeshment with the individual's abusive family of origin, or ongoing involvement in criminal subgroups. Poorer functioning may also be related to perpetration of child maltreatment or intimate partner violence by individuals with dissociative identity disorder.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Many features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual's sociocultural background. In settings where possession symptoms are common (e.g., rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe), all or some of the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the presentation of the other identities (e.g., identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-form dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, and uncontrollable; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate cultural or religious norms. Combined dissociative-psychosis episodes may be more common in cultural contexts with marked communal violence or oppression and limited opportunity for redress.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not in child/adolescent clinical settings or in general population studies. Few differences in symptom profiles, clinical history, and childhood trauma history have been found in comparisons between men and women with dissociative identity disorder, except that women may have higher rates of somatization.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Suicidal behavior is frequent. Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder have attempted suicide; multiple attempts are common, and other self-injurious and high-risk behaviors are highly prevalent. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder have multiple interacting risk factors for self-destructive and/or suicidal behavior. These include cumulative, severe early- and later-life trauma; high rates of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive disorders, and substance use disorders; and personality disorder features. Dissociation itself is an independent risk factor for multiple suicide attempts. Greater severity of dissociative symptom scores is associated with a higher frequency of suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury among individuals with dissociative disorders.",
        "Functional Consequences of Dissociative Identity Disorder": "Some children and adolescents with dissociative identity disorder may function poorly in school and in relationships. Others do well in school, experiencing it as a respite. In adults impairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in high-functioning professionals) to profound. The symptoms of higher-functioning individuals may impair their relational, marital, family, and parenting functions more than their occupational and professional life, although the latter also may be affected. Many impaired individuals show improvement in occupational and personal functioning over time, while some individuals with dissociative identity disorder may be impaired in most activities of living and function at the level of chronic and persistent mental illness."

      "comorbidity": "As is common in individuals with a history of trauma, many comorbidities co-occur with dissociative amnesia, particularly as dissociative amnesia begins to remit. A wide variety of affective phenomena may surface, including dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, and psychological conflict and turmoil. Individuals may engage in nonsuicidal self-injury and other high-risk behaviors. These individuals may have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, or subthreshold depression (other specified depressive disorder). Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point during their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia are brought into conscious awareness. Many of these individuals may show symptoms of the dissociative subtype of PTSD. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for a comorbid somatic symptom and related disorder (and vice versa), particularly functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder). Substance-related and addictive disorders may be comorbid with dissociative amnesia, as well as feeding and eating disorders and sexual dysfunctions. The most common comorbid personality disorder is other specified personality disorder (with mixed personality disorder features), which often includes avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, dependent, and borderline features.",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important autobiographical information that 1) should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinarily would be freely recollected (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia is conceptualized as a potentially reversible memory retrieval deficit. In this way, among others, it differs from the amnesias attributable to neurobiological damage or toxicity that impair memory storage or retrieval. A variety of types of dissociative amnesia may manifest. In general, the memory deficit in dissociative amnesia is retrograde and, except in rare cases, is not associated with ongoing amnesia for contemporary life events. Retrospective memory impairments include not only lost memories of traumatic experiences but also lost memories of everyday life during which no trauma occurred. Most commonly, individuals with dissociative amnesia report localized amnesia-a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time; and/or selective amnesia-the individual can recall some, but not all, of the events during a circumscribed period of time. In systematized amnesia the individual fails to recall a specific category of important information (e.g., fragmentary recall of home growing up, but continuous memory for school; no recall of a violent older sibling; lack of recall of a specific room in the individual's childhood home). Individuals rarely overtly complain of symptoms of these forms of dissociative amnesia and attempt to minimize and rationalize the memory loss. Generalized dissociative amnesia involves a complete loss of memory for most or all of the individual's life history. Individuals with generalized amnesia may forget personal identity (e.g., a woman loses memory of her entire life history after giving in to repeated pressure from a close friend to engage in a sexual relationship), lose previous knowledge about the world (e.g., recent political events, how to use current technology), and less commonly lack access to well-learned skills (e.g., what contact lenses are and how to put them in). Generalized dissociative amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, disorientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually bring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Dissociative fugue is commonly associated with generalized dissociative amnesia and can be indicated by using the 'with dissociative fugue' specifier. Generalized dissociative amnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and individuals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict. In continuous amnesia (i.e., anterograde dissociative amnesia), an individual forgets each new event as it occurs. Individuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware) of their memory problems. They may recall some traumatic events, or parts of traumatic events, but not others of the same type. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the importance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to address it.",
        "Associated Features": "Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to form and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, especially child abuse, and victimization are common. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flashbacks (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of nonsuicidal self-injury, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive and functional neurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms, and high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) may precede dissociative amnesia.",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small U.S. community study was 1.8%.",
        "Development and Course": "Dissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, adults, and geriatric populations. Amnesia in children younger than 12 may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty understanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate child-friendly questions about memory and amnesia, especially in younger children. Observations of apparent dissociative amnesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, daydreaming, anxiety, oppositional behavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several different sources (e.g., teacher, therapist, case worker) may be needed to diagnose amnesia in children. Some traumatized adolescents with dissociative amnesia are less likely to come to clinical attention because of lower levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) intrusive symptoms and less externalizing behavior. Dissociative fugue behavior in children and adolescents may be limited by the child's life space (e.g., a child in a fugue 'coming to' after bicycling to an unfamiliar neighborhood, a teenager finding herself having taken public transportation to a nearby town). Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Individuals may experience multiple episodes of this type of dissociative amnesia. A single episode may predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or may not appear to be acutely symptomatic. Some episodes of acute generalized amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g., when the individual is removed from combat or some other stressful situation, and/or is brought to clinical attention). A substantial subgroup of individuals develop highly impairing, debilitating, chronic autobiographical memory deficits, such that even 'relearning' their life history does not ameliorate the memory loss. Removal from the traumatic circumstances generating acute, generalized dissociative amnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The memory loss of individuals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Later life trauma, life stresses, or losses may precede breakdown of long-standing autobiographical memory deficits related to childhood or adult trauma, with the onset of acute PTSD, mood disorders, substance abuse, and dangerousness to self or others, among other symptoms.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental. Severe, acute, or chronic traumatization is the main risk factor for dissociative amnesia. Cumulative early life trauma and adversities, especially physical and sexual abuse, are the major risk factors for dissociative amnesia for childhood and adolescence. More severe sexual abuse, multiple episodes of childhood sexual abuse, and sexual abuse by a relative, especially with betrayal by a close attachment figure, may increase the extent of childhood autobiographical memory disturbances. Individuals with dissociative amnesia may deny recall of specific childhood traumas (e.g., sexual assault), even those documented in medical or social service reports, although the individual can recall other similar traumatic events, both before and after the amnestic event. Severe cumulative adult trauma (e.g., repeated combat, trafficking, prisoner-of-war or concentration camp experiences) also may result in extensive localized, selective, and/or systematized dissociative amnesia. Generalized dissociative amnesia may be more common among individuals who have recently experienced extreme acute traumas (e.g., brutal military combat, rape, torture, often in the context of inability to escape) and/or a prior history of major social dislocation, asylum-seeking, or refugee status. Others develop generalized amnesia in the context of profound psychological conflict from which the individual also feels unable to escape. Virtually all individuals who develop generalized dissociative amnesia in the context of psychological conflict report past histories of severe early life and/or adult traumatization. Extreme acute traumatic experiences also may engender major psychological conflicts (e.g., a woman develops generalized amnesia after experiencing a brutal rape resulting in an unwanted pregnancy and becomes suicidal; on assessment, she reveals that her religion views abortion as murder and suicide as a major sin).\n\nGenetic and physiological. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that genetics account for about 50% of the interindividual variance in dissociative symptoms, with nonshared, stressful environmental experiences accounting for most of the additional variance. Candidate gene studies suggest a gene x environment interplay with earlier and more chronic childhood traumatic experiences leading to significant increases in dissociative symptoms later in life.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "In cultural contexts where possession is part of normative religious or spiritual practice, dissociative amnesia and fugue may be interpreted as resulting from pathological possession. In contexts or situations where individuals feel highly constrained by social circumstances or cultural traditions, the precipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve frank trauma. Instead, the amnesia may be preceded by severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e.g., marital conflict, other family disturbances, attachment problems, or conflicts attributable to restriction or oppression).",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in individuals with dissociative amnesia. The psychological forces producing generalized amnesia may be extreme, and suicidal thoughts, impulses, plans, and behavior are a risk when amnesia decreases. Case reports suggest that suicidal behavior may be a particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly and overwhelms the individual with intolerable memories.",
        "Functional Consequences of Dissociative Amnesia": "Impairments in individuals with dissociative amnesia resulting from childhood/adolescent traumatization range from limited to severe. Some of these individuals may be chronically impaired in their ability to form and sustain satisfactory attachments. Some may become highly successful in occupational functioning but often do so by compulsive overwork. Individuals with acute generalized dissociative amnesia usually have impairment in all aspects of functioning. A substantial subgroup of individuals with generalized amnesia develop a highly impairing, chronic autobiographical memory deficit that even relearning their life history does not ameliorate. These individuals experience a highly debilitated, chronic course with poor overall functioning in most domains of life."

      "comorbidity": "In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research studies, lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder, with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring personality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive.",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the individual's whole self or from aspects of the self (Criterion A1). The individual may feel detached from his or her entire being (e.g., 'I am no one,' 'I have no self'). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality: 'I know I have feelings, but I don't feel them'), thoughts (e.g., 'My thoughts don't feel like my own,' 'head filled with cotton'), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch, proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of speech or movements). The depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part observing and one participating, known as an 'out-of-body experience' in its most extreme form. The unitary symptom of 'depersonalization' consists of several symptom factors: anomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emotional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall. Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings (Criterion A2). The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and the world around. Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly accompanied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensionality, or altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions can also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted or heightened.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder may have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are 'crazy' or 'going crazy.' Another common experience is the fear of irreversible brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a subjectively altered sense of time (i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty in vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and emotional. Vague somatic symptoms, such as head fullness, tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon. Individuals may experience extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly obsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine whether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are also common associated features. Individuals with the disorder have been found to have physiological hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic circuits.",
        "Prevalence": "Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days are common in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to be markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise estimates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults have experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization/derealization. However, symptomatology that meets full criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder is markedly less common than transient symptoms. One-month prevalence in the United Kingdom is approximately 1%-2%.",
        "Development and Course": "The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only 5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can range from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of depersonalization/derealization disorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks, months, or years). Given the rarity of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the individual should be examined more closely for underlying medical conditions (e.g., brain lesions, seizure disorders, sleep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent. About one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms from the start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that eventually becomes continuous. While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably, others report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly present for years or decades. Internal and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary between individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can be triggered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or overstimulating settings, and physical factors such as lighting or lack of sleep.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder are characterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and overconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as idealization/devaluation, projection, and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection schemata reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse, neglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired autonomy with themes of dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence.\n\nEnvironmental. There is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interpersonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prevalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as dissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been most strongly and consistently associated with the disorder. Other stressors can include physical abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill parent; or unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a much less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipitants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anxiety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine; 'ecstasy'), and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset panic attacks and depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can be a part of meditative practices that are prevalent in many religious, spiritual, and cultural contexts and should not be diagnosed as a disorder. However, there are individuals who initially induce these states intentionally but over time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for related practices. Cultural frameworks may affect the level of distress or perceived severity associated with uncontrolled depersonalization/derealization experiences by providing explanations for them (e.g., spiritual/supernatural causes), which may alleviate individuals' fears that they are 'losing their mind.'",
        "Functional Consequences of Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder": "Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly distressing and are associated with major morbidity. The affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these individuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal and occupational spheres, largely as a result of the hypoemotionality with others, subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from life."

",
      "comorbidity": "Somatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with other mental disorders as well as general medical conditions.  The most relevant co-occurring mental disorders are anxiety and depressive disorders, each of which occurs in up to 50% of cases of somatic symptom disorders and significantly contributes to overall functional impairment and poorer quality of life.  Other mental disorders that have been found to co-occur with somatic symptom disorder are posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Other evidence indicates an association with sexual dysfunction in men.  Elevated levels of the psychological features (Criterion B) of somatic symptom disorder have been found in several general medical conditions.  When a concurrent general medical condition is present, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected from the physical illness alone.  Moreover, somatization in medical illness has been shown to worsen disease and treatment outcomes, adherence, and quality of life and to increase health care utilization. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), although sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present.  Symptoms may be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue).  The symptoms sometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally signify serious disease.  Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not sufficient to make this diagnosis.  The individual's suffering is authentic, whether or not it is medically explained.  The symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition.  The diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually exclusive, and these frequently occur together.  For example, an individual may become seriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability.  If another medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e.g., strong family history), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive (Criterion B).  Individuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry about illness (Criterion B).  They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health.  Even when there is evidence to the contrary, some individuals still fear the medical seriousness of their symptoms.  In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in the individual's life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interpersonal relationships.  Individuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symptoms and their significance.  When asked directly about their distress, some individuals describe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress other than the somatic symptoms.  Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both physically and mentally.  The diagnosis can further be specified by stating whether complaints predominantly involve pain and/or if complaints are marked by a persistent course.  Additionally, severity of somatic symptom disorder can be specified by the number of fulfilled B criteria.  Mild forms of somatic symptom disorder (one symptom as specified in Criterion B is fulfilled) are more prevalent, while moderate (two or more B criteria are present) and severe cases (two or more symptoms as specified in Criterion B are fulfilled in combination with multiple somatic complaints or one very severe somatic symptom) are marked by higher levels of impairment.  In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked, and when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism.  There is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individual's concerns.  Consequently, the individual may seek care from multiple doctors for the same symptoms.  These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new interventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms.  Some individuals with the disorder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects.  Some feel that their medical assessment and treatment have been inadequate.  The criteria for somatic symptom disorder appear suitable for use in children and adolescents, but they have been less studied in youth than among adults. ",
        "Associated Features": "Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal bodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry about illness, a self-concept of bodily weakness, and intolerance of bodily complaints.  Besides health anxiety, emotional features may include negative affectivity, desperation, and demoralization related to somatic symptoms.  The relevant associated behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, repeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity.  These behavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder.  These features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical help for different somatic symptoms.  This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so focused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other matters.  Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious physical illness tends to be short-lived and/or is experienced by the individuals as the doctor not taking their symptoms with due seriousness.  As the focus on somatic symptoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically present to general medical health services rather than mental health services.  The suggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with surprise or even frank refusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is unclear.  Estimates about the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder come from the limited epidemiological literature on DSM-IV-TR somatoform disorders.  However, the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-IV-TR somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform disorder (approximately 19%).  More recent population-based studies with a questionnaire-based strategy using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder in adult and adolescent samples report prevalence rates between 6.7% and 17.4%.  Based on research conducted in Europe and North America, the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general adult population can be approximated as 4%-6%.  Somatic symptom disorder has a higher frequency in primary care patients than in the general population.  Based on reviews and meta-analyses of studies from multiple countries that had still used DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria, a 12-month prevalence of somatic symptom disorder and related conditions in primary care patients between 10% and 20% appears plausible.  Prevalence rates are higher in clinical settings that specialize in psychosomatic or functional disorders, with reported frequencies of somatic symptom disorder between 40% and 60%.  Women tend to report more somatic symptoms than do men, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to be higher in women. ",
        "Development and Course": "In a study of Danish children ages 5-7 years, functional somatic symptoms were common health complaints, which for a significant minority (roughly one-fifth) of those with complaints were severe enough to cause distress, impairment, school absences, or medical help-seeking.  Age at onset does not seem to affect the duration of untreated illness.  The course of somatic symptom disorder is likely to be chronic and fluctuating and influenced by the number of symptoms, individual's age, level of impairment, and any comorbidity.  The course is also influenced by personality traits, with less harm avoidance and greater cooperativeness associated with a shorter time to remission.  In children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, and nausea.  A single prominent symptom is more common in children than in adults.  When the diagnosis is being made in younger individuals, it is important to obtain patient, family, and other assessments (e.g., school) of symptom presentation.  Patient and caregiver engagement during evaluation and management is fundamental because parents' interpretation of and response to symptoms may determine the level of associated distress, the demands for medical investigations and interventions, and time away from school.  In older individuals, pain localized in several body regions appears to be the most common symptom.  Somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common as multimorbidity increases with age.  Prevalence rates of somatic symptom disorder seem to be stable until age 65 years and might decrease thereafter.  For making the diagnosis in older individuals, a focus on the requirement for excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns (Criterion B) is crucial.  Somatic symptom disorder may be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered 'understandable' in older adults who have more general medical illnesses and medications than do younger people. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental. The personality trait of negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been identified as an independent correlate/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms.  Comorbid anxiety or depression is common and may exacerbate symptoms and impairment. \n\nEnvironmental. Somatic symptom disorder is more frequent in individuals with few years of education and low socioeconomic status, and in those who have recently experienced stressful or health-related life events.  Early lifetime adversity such as childhood sexual abuse is also likely a risk factor for somatic symptom disorder in adults. \n\nCourse modifiers. Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic features (women, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic status, unemployment), a reported history of sexual abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent chronic physical illness or mental disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive disorder, panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors such as illness benefits.  Total somatic symptom severity is probably associated with female gender, anxiety, depression and general medical illness.  Cognitive factors that affect clinical course include sensitization to pain, heightened attention to bodily sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible medical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or psychological stress. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "High numbers of somatic symptoms are found in population-based and primary care studies around the world, with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported somatic symptoms, impairment, and treatment seeking.  The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and illness worry is similar in different cultural contexts, and marked illness worry is associated with impairment and greater treatment seeking cross-culturally.  In many cultural contexts, individuals with depression commonly present with somatic symptoms.  Despite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms across cultural contexts and ethnoracial groups.  Sociocultural factors, particularly stigma related to mental disorders, may explain differences in somatic symptom reporting across cultural contexts.  The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other local cultural factors.  These somatic presentations have been described as 'idioms of distress' because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician interactions in the particular cultural contexts.  For example, sensations of heaviness, complaints of 'gas,' too much heat in the body, or burning in the head are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others.  Cultural explanations also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular family, work (e.g., burnout), or other environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feelings of anger and resentment; or certain culturally specific attributions, such as semen loss.  Certain somatic symptoms may be part of specific explanatory models in a given cultural context; for example, traditional understandings of shenjing shuairuo in China link concepts of 'weakness of nerves' (neurasthenia) and hot-cold imbalance with prominent symptoms such as fatigue and low energy.  There may also be differences in medical treatment seeking and utilization of nonmedical, traditional, alternative and complementary healing practices among cultural groups, in addition to differences due to variable access to medical care services.  Cultural beliefs, previous illnesses, insurance status, health literacy, and health care experiences can influence individuals' perception of somatic symptoms and health care use.  Seeking treatment for multiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "In population-based studies, women report more somatic symptoms than men, and in one study of primary care patients with chronic pain, women reported more severe somatic symptoms than men.  While exposure to sexual trauma, intimate partner violence, and a childhood trauma history is associated with increased somatic symptom expression in both women and men, a childhood history of multiple adverse childhood experiences is especially likely to increase somatic symptom expression in women.  In women, gender is associated with an increased likelihood of developing persistent symptoms of somatic symptom disorder.  There appears to be no evidence that gender is associated with the duration of untreated illness and response to psychological or pharmacological treatment. ",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Somatic symptom disorder is associated with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.  It is likely that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are partly explained by the diagnostic overlap and frequent comorbidity of somatic symptom disorder and depressive disorders.  In addition, dysfunctional illness perceptions and the severity of somatic symptoms appear to be independently associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Somatic Symptom Disorder": "The disorder is associated with marked impairment of health status and high psychological distress.  Many individuals with severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have impaired health status scores more than 2 standard deviations below population norms.  Health status is particularly impaired in the presence of multiple or severe symptoms. "

Approximately two-thirds of individuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid major mental disorder.  Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk for personality disorders. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "Most individuals who previously would have been diagnosed with hypochondriasis in DSM-IV (preoccupation with having a serious disease based on the individual's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms) are now classified as having somatic symptom disorder; however, in one-third of cases, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies instead.  Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A).  Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B).  A thorough evaluation fails to identify a serious medical condition that accounts for the individual's concerns.  While the concern may be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual's distress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her anxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i.e., the suspected medical diagnosis).  If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e.g., transient tinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belching).  If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccupation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion B).  Most empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypochondriasis and health anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the description of this new diagnosis.  The preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety about health and disease (Criterion C).  Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easily alarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health-related news story.  Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course.  The physician's attempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual's concerns and may heighten them.  Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the individual's life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism.  Illness becomes a central feature of the individual's identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social discourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events.  Individuals with the disorder often examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one's throat in the mirror) (Criterion D).  They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and repeatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians.  This incessant worrying often becomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family.  In some cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick family members) or activities (e.g., exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize their health. ",
        "Associated Features": "Because they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered far more frequently in medical than in mental health settings.  The majority of individuals with illness anxiety disorder have extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care.  They generally have elevated rates of utilization of medical and mental health services compared with the general population.  In a minority of cases of illness anxiety disorder, individuals are too anxious to seek medical attention and avoid medical health care.  They often consult multiple physicians for the same problem and obtain repeatedly negative diagnostic test results.  At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical exacerbation of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and procedures.  Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied with their medical care and find it unhelpful, often feeling they are not being taken seriously by physicians.  At times, these concerns may be justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond with frustration or hostility.  This response can occasionally result in a failure to diagnose a medical condition that is present. ",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder are based on estimates of the DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis hypochondriasis and health anxiety.  The 1- to 2-year prevalence of health anxiety and/or disease conviction in community surveys and population-based samples from high-income countries such as the United States and Germany ranges from 1.3% to 10%.  In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month/1-year prevalence rates are between 2.2% and 8% across a range of countries, with weighted mean prevalence rates of 3%.  By contrast, in a study of patients in specialty clinics, about one-fifth of individuals reported illness anxiety.  The prevalence of the disorder is similar in men and women. ",
        "Development and Course": "The development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear.  Illness anxiety disorder is generally thought to be a chronic, episodic, and relapsing condition with an age at onset in early and middle adulthood.  The disorder is thought to be rare in children, although the onset of health-related anxieties can occur in childhood or adolescence.  In some population-based samples, health-related anxiety increases with age, but in others, health anxiety peaks in middle age, before declining in older age.  The ages of individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings do not appear to differ from those of other individuals in those settings.  In older individuals, health-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss and sensory loss. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental. Illness anxiety disorder may sometimes be precipitated by a major life stress or a serious but ultimately benign threat to the individual's health.  A history of childhood abuse or of a serious childhood illness, serious illness in a parent, or death of an ill parent during childhood may predispose to development of the disorder in adulthood. \n\nCourse modifiers. Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anxiety disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less psychiatric comorbidity, more medical comorbidity, and less severe illness anxiety disorder. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The diagnosis should be made with caution in individuals whose ideas about disease are congruent with widely held cultural beliefs.  The prevalence appears to be similar across different countries, although little is known about the cross-cultural variation in phenomenology. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Illness Anxiety Disorder": "Illness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and decrements in physical function and health-related quality of life.  Health concerns often interfere with interpersonal relationships, disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance. "

Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor, jerks, or dystonic movements; and gait abnormalities.  Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing.  Episodes of apparent unresponsiveness with or without limb movements may resemble epileptic seizures, syncope, or coma (also called dissociative, psychogenic, or nonepileptic seizures or attacks).  Other symptoms include reduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia); altered speech articulation, prosody, or fluency; a sensation of a lump in the throat (globus); and diplopia.  This disorder has been called 'conversion disorder' in prior editions of DSM as well as in much of the psychiatric research literature.  The term 'conversion originated in psychoanalytic theory, which proposes that unconscious psychic conflict is 'converted' into physical symptoms. \n\nThe diagnosis rests on clinical findings that show clear evidence of incompatibility with recognized neurological disease.  These should usually be elicited and interpreted in the context of the whole clinical picture by a health care professional with expertise in the diagnosis of neurological conditions.  The diagnosis is not one of exclusion and can be made in individuals who also have neurological diseases like epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.  The diagnosis should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or because the symptom is 'bizarre.'  Internal inconsistency during examination is one way to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited through one examination method are no longer present when tested a different way).  There are dozens of examples of such 'positive' examination findings. \n\nExamples of examination findings that indicate incompatibility with recognized neurological disease include the following:\n\n- For functional limb weakness or paralysis: Hoover's sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with contralateral hip flexion against resistance; the hip abductor sign, in which weakness of thigh abduction returns to normal with contralateral hip abduction against resistance; or a discrepancy between on-the-bed performance (e.g., weakness of ankle plantar flexion) compared with another task (e.g., ability to walk on tiptoes). \n- For functional tremor: the tremor entrainment test, in which a tremor changes when the individual is distracted by copying the examiner in making a rhythmical movement with the contralateral hand or foot.  The test is positive when the tremor 'entrains' the rhythm of the unaffected hand or foot, the tremor is suppressed, or the individual cannot copy simple rhythmical movements.  Other features of functional limb tremor include variability in frequency or direction of the tremor. \n- For functional dystonia: individuals typically present with fixed inverted position of the ankle, a clenched fist, or unilateral contraction of platysma, often with sudden onset. \n- For attacks resembling epileptic seizures or syncope (also called functional or dissociative [nonepileptic] seizures): features suggestive of functional neurological symptom disorder include persistent eye closure sometimes with resistance to opening, bilateral motor movements with preserved awareness, or a duration longer than 5 minutes. \n- For functional speech symptoms: internal inconsistencies in speech articulation and phonation. \n- For functional visual symptoms: a tubular visual field (i.e., tunnel vision) and tests that indicate internal inconsistency in visual acuity, such as the 'fogging test' (i.e., while the individual views the eye chart with both eyes open, the 'good' eye is subtly fogged so that any useful binocular vision must be a result of 'bad' eye function). \nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder should be based on the overall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding. ",
        "Associated Features": "Several associated features can support the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder, although none are specific.  There may be a history of other functional somatic symptoms or disorders, especially involving pain and fatigue.  Onset may be associated with stress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature.  The potential etiological relevance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal relationship.  However, while assessment for stress and trauma is important, it may be absent in up to 50% of individuals, and the diagnosis should not be withheld if none is found.  Functional neurological symptom disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during attacks.  The phenomenon of la belle indiff\u00e9rence (i.e., lack of concern about the nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with functional neurological symptom disorder, but it is not specific and should not be used to make the diagnosis.  Similarly, the concept of secondary gain (i.e., when individuals derive external benefits such as money or release from responsibilities) is also not specific to functional neurological symptom disorder. ",
        "Prevalence": "Transient functional neurological symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of the disorder is unknown.  Based on research in the United States and northern Europe, the incidence of individual persistent functional neurological symptoms is estimated to be 4-12/100,000 per year.  Prevalence in specialty clinics appears to be higher, although data are limited.  For example, 5% of outpatients ages 9-17 in a Japanese psychiatric clinic and 6% of adult and adolescent admissions to an inpatient psychiatric hospital in Oman received a diagnosis consistent with functional neurological symptom disorder.  In neurology clinics, around 5%-15% of individuals have a diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder in studies from Scotland and Australia. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset has been reported throughout the life course.  The mean onset of nonepileptic attacks peaks at ages 20-29 years, and motor symptoms have their mean onset at ages 30-39 years.  The symptoms can be transient or persistent.  The prognosis may be better in younger children than in adolescents and adults. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental. Maladaptive personality traits, especially emotional instability, are commonly associated with functional neurological symptom disorder. \n\nEnvironmental. There may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect.  Stressful life events including physical injury are common but not universal triggering factors. \n\nGenetic and physiological. The presence of neurological disease that causes similar symptoms is a risk factor (e.g., around one in five individuals with functional [nonepileptic] seizures also have epilepsy). \n\nCourse modifiers. Short duration of symptoms and agreement with the diagnosis are positive prognostic factors.  Maladaptive personality traits, the presence of comorbid physical disease, and the receipt of disability benefits appear to be negative prognostic factors. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Episodes of unresponsiveness (including seizures) and motor symptoms are the most common functional neurological symptoms across cultural contexts.  High comorbidity between functional neurological and dissociative symptoms is common cross-culturally, especially in individuals with nonepileptic seizures.  Changes resembling functional neurological (and dissociative) symptoms are common in certain culturally sanctioned rituals.  If the symptoms are fully explained within the particular cultural context and do not result in clinically significant distress or disability, then the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder is not made. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Functional neurological symptom disorder is two to three times more common in women for most symptom presentations.  One large clinical study found higher rates of cognitive impairment and weakness in men and increased past sexual and physical trauma in women. ",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Cohort studies of functional neurological symptom disorder mostly show higher rates of suicidal thoughts and attempts.  Individuals with functional symptoms in a neurology clinic have a higher rate of suicidal thoughts than individuals with recognized neurological disease.  A study in Turkey of 100 consecutive psychiatric outpatients with functional neurological symptom disorder found that a history of suicide attempt was associated with risky use of alcohol, a history of childhood maltreatment, and greater severity of dissociative symptoms as compared with those who did not attempt suicide. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder": "Individuals with functional neurological symptom disorder may have substantial physical disability.  The severity of disability can be similar to that experienced by individuals with comparable recognized medical conditions. "

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the presence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability (Criterion B).  These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its course or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by influencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate medical attention.  Psychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress, patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive health behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adherence to medical recommendations.  Common clinical examples are anxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manipulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes wishing to lose weight.  Many different psychological factors have been demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions for example, symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style, personality traits, and coping styles.  The adverse effects can range from acute, with immediate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), to chronic, occurring over a long period of time (e.g., chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension).  Affected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g., diabetes, cancer, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g., migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia), or idiopathic medical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness).  This diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological factor on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has clinically significant effects on the course or outcome of the medical condition.  Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor).  There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an association between the psychological factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be possible to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the relationship. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is unclear.  In U.S. private insurance billing data, it was a more common diagnosis than DSM-IV somatic symptom disorders. ",
        "Development and Course": "Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur across the lifespan.  Particularly with young children, corroborative history from parents or school can assist the diagnostic evaluation.  Some conditions are characteristic of particular life stages (e.g., in older individuals, the stress associated with acting as a caregiver for an ill spouse or partner). ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Many differences between cultural contexts may influence psychological factors and their effects on medical conditions, such as those in language and communication style, idioms of distress, explanatory models of illness, patterns of seeking health care, service availability and organization, doctor-patient relationships and other healing practices, family and gender roles, and attitudes toward pain and death.  Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions must be differentiated from culturally specific coping behaviors such as accessing faith, spiritual, or traditional healers or other variations in illness management that are acceptable within cultural contexts and represent an attempt to help heal the medical condition.  These local practices may complement rather than obstruct evidence-based interventions.  Use of alternative healing practices may delay use of medical services and affect outcomes, but when the intent of the healing practice is to address the problem in a culturally sanctioned way, these practices should not be pathologized as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.

Methods of illness falsification can include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and induction.

Individuals with factitious disorder might, for example, report feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts or behavior following the death of a spouse despite the death not being true or the individual's not having a spouse; deceptively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness, or blacking out); manipulate a laboratory test (e.g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnormality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e.g., insulin or warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure themselves or induce illness in themselves or another (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce an abscess or to induce sepsis).  Although individuals with factitious disorder most often present to health care professionals for treatment of their factitious symptoms, some individuals with factitious disorder choose to mislead community members in person or online about illness or injury without necessarily engaging health care professionals.

Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on another sometimes falsely allege the presence of educational deficits or disabilities in their children for which they demand special attention, often at considerable inconvenience to education professionals.  Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders might represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious disorder imposed on another, in which the parent's actions represent abuse and maltreatment of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive.

Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also occur during the course of other mental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome, where an additional diagnosis of pica is given only if the behavior is severe enough to warrant extra clinical attention.",
      "comorbidity": "Disorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder and intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder; in these cases, the hair or skin is typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. When pica is present, assessment for gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and nutritional deficiency is recommended.",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature of pica is the persistent eating of one or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances over at least one month (Criterion A), severe enough to warrant clinical attention. Typical substances ingested vary with age and availability and may include paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal, pebbles, charcoal, coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The diagnosis does not apply to diet products with minimal nutritional content. There is typically no general aversion to food. The eating must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B), so a minimum age of 2 years is suggested to exclude normal infant mouthing of objects. The behavior must not be part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice (Criterion C). If the eating behavior occurs with another mental disorder (like intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia), a separate pica diagnosis is made only if the behavior is severe enough to require additional clinical attention (Criterion D).",
        "Associated Features": "Often, no specific biological abnormalities like vitamin or mineral deficiencies are found. Pica may come to clinical attention only after medical complications arise, such as mechanical bowel problems, intestinal obstruction (bezoars), perforation, infections from ingesting feces or dirt (toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis), or poisoning from substances like lead-based paint.",
        "Prevalence": "Limited data suggest a prevalence of about 5% among school-age children. About one-third of pregnant women, especially those with food insecurity, engage in pica. The condition is associated with lack of available food and vitamin deficiencies.",
        "Development and Course": "Pica can start in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, but childhood onset is most common. In adults, it is more likely to occur alongside intellectual disability or other mental disorders, while it can occur in otherwise normally developing children. The disorder can have a protracted course and lead to medical emergencies, and can be fatal depending on the substances ingested.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental factors such as neglect, lack of supervision, and developmental delay can increase risk.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "In some cultures, eating earth or other nonnutritive substances has spiritual, medicinal, or social value. Such culturally supported practices do not warrant a pica diagnosis (Criterion C). While pica may be prevalent in certain cultural groups, it should not be assumed to be normative without evaluation.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Pica occurs in both males and females. During pregnancy, specific cravings (e.g., for chalk or ice) may occur. A diagnosis is only appropriate if these cravings lead to ingesting nonnutritive, nonfood substances that pose potential medical risks. A worldwide meta-analysis showed a 28% prevalence of pica during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Abdominal X-rays, ultrasound, or other scans may reveal obstructions. Blood tests can be used to check for poisoning or infection.",
        "Functional Consequences of Pica": "Pica can significantly impair physical functioning. It rarely impairs social functioning on its own, but often co-occurs with other disorders that are associated with impaired social functioning."

If it occurs with another mental disorder, like intellectual disability, it must be severe enough to need extra clinical attention (Criterion D). The disorder can be diagnosed at any age. The behavior can often be directly observed by a clinician, or diagnosed based on self-report or information from caregivers. Individuals may describe it as habitual or uncontrollable.",
        "Associated Features": "Infants with the disorder often strain and arch their back, with their head held back, and make sucking movements, seemingly gaining satisfaction from the activity. They might be irritable and hungry between episodes. Weight loss and failure to gain weight are common in infants, and malnutrition can occur, especially in severe cases. Adolescents and adults may try to hide the behavior by coughing or covering their mouth, and may avoid eating with others or before social events.",
        "Prevalence": "While historically described mainly in individuals with intellectual disability, limited European data suggest a prevalence of 1%-2% in grade-school-age children.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset can be in infancy (usually 3-12 months), childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. In infants, it often remits spontaneously but can be protracted and result in medical emergencies, including death. The course can be episodic or continuous until treated. The behavior may serve a self-soothing or self-stimulating function, similar to head banging, especially in individuals with intellectual developmental disorder.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental factors like lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life situations, and problematic parent-child relationships may be predisposing factors in infants and young children.",
        "Functional Consequences of Rumination Disorder": "Malnutrition can lead to growth delay and affect development and learning. Older individuals may restrict their food intake due to the social undesirability of the behavior, leading to weight loss. Social functioning is often adversely affected."

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The main feature of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is avoiding or restricting food, leading to consequences like significant weight loss, nutritional deficiency, dependence on supplements/enteral feeding, or marked psychosocial interference (Criterion A). This avoidance can be based on sensory aspects of food (like color, texture, smell), a conditioned negative response from an aversive experience (like choking), or a general lack of interest in eating. 'Significant weight loss' (A1) is a clinical judgment, and for children, it can mean a failure to meet expected weight gain. 'Significant nutritional deficiency' (A2) is also clinically assessed and can lead to health impacts similar to anorexia nervosa. 'Dependence' on feeding support (A3) means it's required for adequate intake. 'Marked interference with psychosocial functioning' (A4) can include an inability to eat with others or sustain relationships. The disorder is not diagnosed if the restriction is due to lack of available food or cultural practices like religious fasting (Criterion B). A key distinction is the absence of excessive concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C). Finally, the disturbance is not better explained by a concurrent medical condition or another mental disorder, unless its severity warrants additional clinical attention (Criterion D).",
        "Associated Features": "Associated features vary with age. Young infants may refuse food, gag, or vomit. They may not engage with caregivers during feeding. Older children and adolescents may show generalized emotional difficulties. The term 'food avoidance emotional disorder' is sometimes used for these presentations.",
        "Prevalence": "There is limited information on prevalence. A study in Australia reported a frequency of 0.3% among individuals aged 15 years or older.",
        "Development and Course": "Lack of interest in eating commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and can persist. Avoidance based on sensory characteristics also tends to arise in the first decade. Avoidance related to aversive consequences can begin at any age. Long-term outcomes suggest that sensory-based avoidance is often stable. There is insufficient evidence linking this disorder to the later onset of other eating disorders. In infants, the disorder can be associated with irritability or apathy, and caregiver-child interactions may contribute to the problem. Inadequate nutrition can worsen associated features like irritability and developmental lags.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors include anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, OCD, and ADHD, which can increase risk. Environmental factors include familial anxiety and having a mother with an eating disorder. Genetic and physiological factors include a history of gastrointestinal conditions, reflux, and vomiting.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Similar presentations are found worldwide. The diagnosis is not made if food avoidance is solely due to religious or cultural practices.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is approximately equally common in boys and girls. However, when comorbid with autism spectrum disorder, it has a male predominance.",
        "Functional Consequences of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder": "The disorder can impair physical development and cause social difficulties, which can significantly impact family function."

      "comorbidity": "Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders are common comorbidities. Many individuals report anxiety symptoms prior to the onset of the eating disorder.

Crossover between subtypes is common, so the subtype description should reflect current symptoms, not the longitudinal course.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The three essential features are: 1) persistent energy intake restriction leading to significantly low body weight (Criterion A); 2) intense fear of gaining weight or behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B); and 3) a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape (Criterion C). 'Significantly low weight' is less than minimally normal for age, sex, and development. For adults, a BMI less than 17.0 kg/m\u00b2 is likely considered significantly low, while for children, a BMI-for-age below the 5th percentile is suggestive. The intense fear of gaining weight (Criterion B) is not usually lessened by weight loss. The experience of body weight and shape is distorted (Criterion C); individuals may feel globally overweight or see specific body parts as 'too fat.' Weight loss is often seen as an achievement, while weight gain is seen as a failure. Individuals frequently lack insight into or deny the seriousness of their low weight, and are often brought to clinical attention by family.",
        "Associated Features": "The semistarvation and purging behaviors can lead to significant, life-threatening medical conditions affecting most major organ systems. While many physiological disturbances are reversible with nutritional rehabilitation, some, like loss of bone mineral density, may not be. Depressive signs and symptoms are common and may be secondary to malnutrition. Obsessive-compulsive features, especially preoccupations with food, are also prominent. Other associated features include concerns about eating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, inflexible thinking, and restrained emotional expression. Those with the binge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and substance abuse compared to the restricting type.",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence in the U.S. ranges from 0.0% to 0.05%, with much higher rates in women. Lifetime prevalence is around 0.6% to 0.8%. It is most prevalent in postindustrialized, high-income countries and appears to be increasing in many low- and middle-income countries. Prevalence seems lower among Latinx and non-Latinx Black Americans than among non-Latinx Whites.",
        "Development and Course": "Anorexia nervosa usually begins in adolescence or young adulthood and is often associated with a stressful life event. The course is highly variable; some recover after a single episode, while others have a fluctuating or chronic course. Hospitalization is often required. Most individuals experience remission within 5 years. The crude mortality rate is about 5% per decade, from medical complications or suicide.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors include childhood anxiety disorders or obsessional traits. Environmental factors include living in cultures where thinness is valued and being in occupations that encourage thinness, like modeling or elite athletics. Genetic and physiological factors include an increased risk among first-degree biological relatives. Genome-wide studies have identified specific risk loci.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder occurs across diverse populations, but there is cross-cultural variation. An expressed fear of weight gain ('fat phobia') may be less common in Asian populations, where dietary restriction might be explained by more culturally accepted reasons like gastrointestinal discomfort.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Laboratory abnormalities can include leukopenia, mild anemia, dehydration (elevated BUN), hypercholesterolemia, and various electrolyte disturbances from purging. Endocrine changes include low T3, low serum estrogen (in females), and low testosterone (in males). EKG may show sinus bradycardia and QTc prolongation. Low bone mineral density is often seen, increasing fracture risk.

Anxiety symptoms or disorders are also common. The lifetime prevalence of substance use disorder is at least 30%. A substantial percentage also have features meeting criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality disorder.",

        "Diagnostic Features": "The three essential features are: 1) recurrent episodes of binge eating, 2) recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, and 3) self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight. These must occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. A binge eating episode involves eating a larger-than-normal amount of food in a discrete period (usually <2 hours) with a sense of lack of control. Individuals are typically ashamed and attempt to conceal their symptoms, often eating in secrecy. Binges are often triggered by negative affect, interpersonal stressors, or dietary restraint. The most common compensatory behavior is self-induced vomiting. Other behaviors include misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, fasting, or excessive exercise. A key feature is that individuals with bulimia nervosa maintain a body weight at or above a minimally normal level, distinguishing them from those with anorexia nervosa.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals are typically within the normal or overweight range. Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea can occur. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances from purging can be medically serious. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears, gastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Chronic laxative abuse can lead to dependence. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common.",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence in U.S. adults is 0.14%-0.3%, with much higher rates in women. Lifetime prevalence is 0.28%-1.0%. The prevalence is similar across U.S. ethnoracial groups and is highest in high-income, industrialized countries, though it appears to be increasing in low- and middle-income countries.",
        "Development and Course": "Bulimia nervosa typically begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset is often during or after a period of dieting. The course can be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission and recurrence. Over the long term, symptoms often diminish. Diagnostic crossover from bulimia to anorexia nervosa occurs in 10%-15% of cases. The crude mortality rate is nearly 2% per decade.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors include weight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and social anxiety. Environmental factors include internalization of a thin body ideal and a history of childhood abuse. Genetic and physiological factors include childhood obesity and early pubertal maturation, as well as familial transmission.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "While prevalence does not differ significantly across U.S. ethnoracial groups, treatment utilization is lower among underserved groups compared to non-Latinx Whites.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is much more common in girls and women than in boys and men.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "No specific diagnostic test exists. Laboratory findings may include hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia from purging, potentially leading to metabolic alkalosis or acidosis. Serum amylase may be elevated. Physical exam may reveal loss of dental enamel, enlarged salivary glands, and calluses or scars on the back of the hand (Russell's sign).",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Suicide risk is elevated. About one-quarter to one-third of individuals have suicidal ideation, and a similar proportion have attempted suicide.",

        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is recurrent episodes of binge eating, occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months. A binge involves eating a larger-than-normal amount of food in a discrete period (usually <2 hours) accompanied by a sense of lack of control. The binge-eating episodes must be associated with marked distress and at least three other features, such as eating very rapidly, eating until uncomfortably full, eating large amounts when not hungry, eating alone due to embarrassment, and feeling disgusted or guilty afterward. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder is not associated with recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors.",
        "Associated Features": "The disorder occurs in normal-weight/overweight and obese individuals and is associated with them. However, it is distinct from obesity, as most obese individuals do not engage in recurrent binge eating. Compared to weight-matched obese individuals without the disorder, those with it consume more calories, have greater functional impairment, more distress, and more psychiatric comorbidity.",

        "Development and Course": "Little is known about its development, but binge eating is common in adolescents and can be associated with weight gain and psychological symptoms. Dieting often follows the development of binge eating, in contrast to bulimia nervosa where dieting usually precedes it. Onset is typically in adolescence or young adulthood but can be later. Remission rates are higher for binge-eating disorder than for anorexia or bulimia. Crossover to other eating disorders is uncommon.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "The disorder appears to run in families, which may reflect genetic influences.",

It is also not diagnosed if it is a side effect of a medication. However, a diagnosis can be made if the incontinence was present before the medical condition or medication use, or if it persists after appropriate treatment of the condition.",
      "comorbidity": "Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral and developmental symptoms is higher in children with both diurnal and nocturnal enuresis. Developmental delays in speech, language, learning, and motor skills are also seen in some children with enuresis. Encopresis and constipation can be present. Restless legs syndrome and parasomnias like sleepwalking and sleep terrors are associated with nocturnal enuresis. There is also a link between nocturnal enuresis and heavy snoring or sleep apneas , and about 50% of these children become dry after an adenotonsillectomy. Urinary tract infections are more common in children with daytime or nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.",
      "full_text": {
        "Subtypes": "The nocturnal-only subtype (monosymptomatic enuresis) is the most common and involves incontinence only during nighttime sleep. The diurnal-only subtype occurs only during waking hours and can be divided into two groups: 'urge incontinence' with sudden urges and detrusor instability, and 'voiding postponement' where individuals consciously delay urinating until incontinence occurs. The nocturnal-and-diurnal subtype is also known as nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature of enuresis is the repeated, and most often involuntary, voiding of urine into bed or clothes (Criterion A). For a diagnosis, this must occur at least twice a week for 3 consecutive months or cause significant distress or impairment (Criterion B). The individual must have a chronological or mental age of at least 5 years (Criterion C). The behavior cannot be attributed to a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D).",
        "Associated Features": "Nocturnal enuresis may occur during REM sleep, and the child might recall a dream about urinating. During diurnal enuresis, a child might delay voiding due to social anxiety or being preoccupied with an activity, with events commonly occurring in the early afternoon on school days. Children with executive functioning problems are at high risk for urinary incontinence without sensory awareness.",
        "Prevalence": "Daytime incontinence prevalence ranges from 3.2%-9.0% at age 7, to 1.1%-4.2% at ages 11-13, and 1.2%-3.0% at ages 15-17. Nocturnal enuresis prevalence decreases with age, affecting 5%-10% of 5-year-olds, 3%-5% of 10-year-olds, and about 1% of individuals 15 or older. Prevalence may be higher in boys, socially oppressed groups, and youth with learning disabilities or ADHD.",
        "Development and Course": "Enuresis can be 'primary,' where the child has never been continent, or 'secondary,' where it develops after a period of continence. Secondary enuresis most commonly begins between ages 5 and 8. After age 5, the spontaneous remission rate is 5%-10% per year, and most children become continent by adolescence. Diurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Developmental delays and neuropsychiatric problems are suggested predisposing factors for bladder dysfunction. Environmental factors include delayed toilet training and psychosocial stress. Genetically, nocturnal enuresis is associated with a mismatch between nocturnal urine production, bladder capacity, and the ability to arouse from sleep. The disorder is heritable; the risk is about 3.6 times higher if the mother was enuretic and 10.1 times higher if the father had urinary incontinence.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Enuresis is reported in many countries with similar prevalence rates and developmental trajectories. However, local surveys show wide variation, and very high rates are found in orphanages and institutions. Cultural contexts can affect the diagnosis and perceived cause; for example, traditional Chinese medicine attributes it to kidney yang deficiency. The impact on parents may be heightened in societies with economic limitations or restrictive social policies.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males than females, with a ratio of almost 2:1, especially in younger children. Diurnal incontinence, however, is more common in females, and the ratio increases with age. Urinary tract infections are frequently associated with daytime wetting, particularly in females. The risk of a child developing enuresis is greater for previously enuretic fathers than mothers.",
        "Functional Consequences of Enuresis": "Impairment is related to limitations on a child's social life (e.g., being unable to attend sleep-away camp), the effect on their self-esteem, social ostracism from peers, and negative reactions from caregivers like anger and punishment."

Fecal incontinence from other medical conditions like chronic diarrhea, spina bifida, or anal stenosis does not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis.",
      "comorbidity": "Enuresis is frequently present in children with encopresis, especially in those without constipation and overflow incontinence.",
      "full_text": {
        "Subtypes": "In the subtype 'with constipation and overflow incontinence,' feces are often poorly formed, and leakage can range from infrequent to continuous, day and night. Incontinence usually resolves after the constipation is treated. In the 'without constipation and overflow incontinence' subtype, feces are likely to be of normal form, and soiling is intermittent. The feces might be deposited in a prominent place and this subtype is often associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Soiling without constipation is the less common subtype.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The key feature is the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places, which can be involuntary or intentional (Criterion A). This must occur at least once a month for a minimum of 3 months (Criterion B) in a child who is chronologically or mentally at least 4 years old (Criterion C). The behavior cannot be due to a substance or a medical condition, unless the mechanism involves constipation (Criterion D). Involuntary passage is often linked to constipation with overflow. Constipation can develop for psychological reasons, such as anxiety about defecation or oppositional behavior, leading to stool retention. Physiological predispositions to constipation also exist.",
        "Associated Features": "The child often feels ashamed and may avoid social situations like camp or school. The level of impairment depends on the impact on the child's self-esteem, peer ostracism, and caregiver reactions. Smearing of feces can be deliberate or accidental from attempts to clean up. If the soiling is deliberate, features of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder may be present. Many children with encopresis and constipation also have enuresis.",
        "Prevalence": "Most children older than 4 with encopresis have the subtype with constipation and overflow incontinence. Encopresis affects 1%-4% of children in high-income countries and 2%-8% in some Asian countries. It is more prevalent in children aged 4-6 (>4%) than those aged 10-12 (<2%) and is also higher among children who have experienced abuse or neglect and those from low-income families.",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is not diagnosed before a chronological or mental age of 4. Inconsistent toilet training and psychosocial stress can be predisposing factors. The course can be 'primary' (fecal continence was never established) or 'secondary' (develops after a period of continence). Encopresis can persist for years with intermittent worsening.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Painful defecation can lead to a cycle of constipation and withholding behaviors that increase the likelihood of encopresis. Male gender and age before adolescence are risk factors. Anxiety, depression, behavioral disorders, psychological stressors, and lower socioeconomic status are also thought to contribute.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cultural differences in diet and psychosocial adversity may influence the incidence of constipation and fecal retention leading to encopresis. Some parents may not seek help for sociocultural or religious reasons, such as concerns about the impurity of feces.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The gender ratio is equal in children under 5, but encopresis is more common in boys than girls among older children, with ratios varying globally from 2:1 to 6:1.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "The diagnosis is clinical and based on history and physical examination. A rectal fecal impaction found on digital exam or an abdominal radiograph supports the diagnosis of the subtype with constipation and overflow incontinence. Colonic transit testing can help differentiate between the subtypes. Anorectal manometry may be helpful for understanding physiological factors in certain children.",
        "Functional Consequences of Encopresis": "Encopresis is associated with a significant decrease in health-related quality of life and family functioning, especially in older children."

      "comorbidity": "Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, chronic pain conditions, and degenerative brain diseases. The relationship is often bidirectional. Insomnia also coexists with other sleep disorders; about one in seven individuals with insomnia has moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea , and about 50% of individuals with narcolepsy report insomnia. It frequently co-occurs with mental disorders, especially bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders , and is a risk factor for their subsequent development.",
      "full_text": {
        "Recording Procedures": "The specifiers for comorbidity ('with mental disorder,' 'with medical condition,' 'with another sleep disorder') are used to note clinically relevant conditions. When using these, the diagnosis should be recorded as F51.01 insomnia disorder, with the name of the comorbid condition(s), followed by the diagnostic code(s) for those conditions. For example: F51.01 insomnia disorder, with moderate cocaine use disorder and trigeminal neuralgia; F14.20 moderate cocaine use disorder; G50.0 trigeminal neuralgia.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, with complaints of difficulty initiating, maintaining, or returning to sleep. This causes significant distress or impairment in functioning. The most common single symptom is difficulty maintaining sleep (middle insomnia), followed by early awakening (late insomnia) and difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia). The diagnosis is based on the individual's subjective perception of sleep difficulty. Daytime impairments include fatigue, mood disturbances, and difficulties with attention, concentration, and memory.",
        "Associated Features": "Insomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive hyperarousal and conditioned factors that interfere with sleep. A vicious cycle can develop where the effort to sleep leads to frustration and further impairs sleep. Individuals may acquire maladaptive sleep habits like spending excessive time in bed or clock monitoring. Some report better sleep when away from their usual bedroom. They may also have an increased incidence of stress-related symptoms like tension headaches.",
        "Prevalence": "About one-third of adults report insomnia symptoms, while 4%-22% meet the criteria for insomnia disorder, making it the most prevalent sleep disorder. In primary care settings, 20%-40% of individuals report significant insomnia symptoms. Forty to fifty percent of individuals with an insomnia disorder have a comorbid mental disorder. It is more prevalent in women than men, with a gender ratio of about 1.3:1.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset can occur at any time, but the first episode is most common in young adulthood. In women, incidence increases with menopause. Insomnia can be situational (lasting a few days or weeks, often linked to life events), persistent, or recurrent. For some, acute insomnia can become chronic due to conditioning factors long after the triggering event has passed. Insomnia during a major depressive episode may persist even after the depression resolves in 40%-50% of individuals. Chronicity rates range from 45% to 75% over 1-7 years of follow-up.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors like anxiety-prone personalities increase vulnerability. Environmental factors include noise, light, uncomfortable temperatures, and high altitude. Genetic and physiological factors include female sex and advancing age. The disorder shows familial disposition, with 35%-70% of those with insomnia reporting a first-degree relative with a history of it.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "While insomnia is a universal experience, its identification as a problem and the associated help-seeking behaviors are affected by culture. In some cultures, it may be seen as a normal part of aging or stress. Explanatory models vary greatly, attributing insomnia to environmental factors (e.g., humidity) or bodily processes (e.g., poor circulation).",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "First onset in females is often linked to childbirth or menopause. Despite higher prevalence in postmenopausal women, polysomnographic studies show they have better preservation of sleep continuity than older men.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Polysomnography is not always necessary for diagnosis but can show increased sleep latency and wake time after sleep onset. Individuals with insomnia often underestimate their sleep duration compared to polysomnography data. Neuroimaging and other lab measures show evidence of increased physiological and cognitive arousal, consistent with hyperarousal playing a significant role in the disorder.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "The symptom of insomnia has been identified as an independent risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior.",
        "Functional Consequences of Insomnia Disorder": "Insomnia can lead to interpersonal, social, and occupational problems due to irritability and poor concentration. It is associated with higher rates of accidents. Persistent insomnia is a significant risk factor for new-onset major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, as well as numerous cardiovascular diseases.",
        "Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders": "DSM-5 insomnia disorder closely parallels the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICSD-3) diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder. However, ICSD-3 does not have a separate diagnosis for substance/medication-induced insomnia."

        "Diagnostic Features": "Hypersomnolence disorder involves excessive sleep quantity, daytime sleepiness, and sleep inertia (impaired performance after awakening). Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in sedentary situations, like reading or watching TV. The persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior, such as driving for several miles with no subsequent memory of it. About 40% of individuals experience sleep inertia, or 'sleep drunkenness,' which involves confusion, combativeness, or ataxia upon waking and can last for minutes to hours. The main sleep period may last 9 hours or more but is often nonrestorative.",
        "Associated Features": "Approximately 80% of individuals report that their sleep is nonrestorative. Daytime naps are often long (over an hour) and unrefreshing. A subset of individuals may have a family history of hypersomnolence and symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, like vascular headaches or fainting.",
        "Prevalence": "Approximately 5%-10% of individuals in sleep disorder clinics with daytime sleepiness complaints are diagnosed with hypersomnolence disorder. It occurs with about equal frequency in men and women.",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean onset age of 17-24 years. The symptoms are typically persistent and stable, although spontaneous remission occurs in 11%-25% of cases after 5-7 years. Diagnosis often occurs 10-15 years after the first symptoms appear.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Viral infections have been reported to precede or accompany the disorder in about 10% of cases. Hypersomnolence is also common in the months after a traumatic brain injury. The disorder may be familial, with an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Nocturnal polysomnography typically shows a normal to prolonged sleep duration with good sleep efficiency (>90%). The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to document sleep tendency, with a mean sleep latency of <8 minutes being typical. However, the MSLT has poor test-retest reliability and doesn't distinguish well between hypersomnolence disorder and narcolepsy type 2.",
        "Functional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder": "The low level of alertness can lead to reduced efficiency, poor concentration, and memory problems. This can cause significant distress in work and social relationships. Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be dangerous if they occur while driving or operating machinery.",
        "Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders": "The ICSD-3 differentiates nine subtypes of 'central disorders of hypersomnolence,' including disorders not covered in DSM-5, such as Kleine-Levin syndrome."

Both NT1 and NT2 can result from other neurological or medical conditions, with tumors and head trauma being the most common causes of secondary narcolepsy.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential features are recurrent daytime sleepiness or naps (at least three times a week for 3 months) along with either cataplexy, hypocretin deficiency, or specific sleep study abnormalities. Cataplexy involves brief, sudden, bilateral loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions, most often positive ones like laughter. In children, it may present as spontaneous grimaces or global hypotonia. Hypocretin deficiency, measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is a sufficient diagnostic test for narcolepsy type 1. The diagnosis can also be confirmed with a nocturnal polysomnogram and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).",
        "Associated Features": "When sleepiness is severe, individuals may perform automatic behaviors without memory or consciousness. About 20%-60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic (at sleep onset) or hypnopompic (upon awakening) hallucinations. Sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or waking is also experienced by 20%-60% of individuals. Disrupted nighttime sleep, vivid dreams, and periodic limb movements are common. Obesity is also common.",
        "Prevalence": "Narcolepsy-cataplexy (NT1) affects 0.02%-0.05% of the adult general population worldwide. Rates are lower in Israel and higher in Japan compared to Europe and the U.S.. The disorder affects both genders about equally.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset is most often in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, with a peak between ages 15-25. Once manifested, the course is persistent and lifelong. In 90% of cases, sleepiness is the first symptom, followed by cataplexy. Diagnostic delays are common, with about 50% of adults recalling symptom onset in childhood or adolescence.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental triggers may include infections like Group A strep or influenza (notably pandemic H1N1 2009), and certain vaccinations, which may trigger an autoimmune process. Genetic factors include a 10- to 40-fold increased prevalence in first-degree relatives. The disorder is strongly associated with the HLA DQB1*06:02 gene.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder has been described in many ethnoracial groups. Among African Americans, it may more often manifest without typical cataplexy. Sleep paralysis may be attributed to supernatural forces in some cultures.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Nocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis. The MSLT is considered positive if it shows an average sleep latency of \u22648 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). CSF hypocretin-1 measurement is particularly useful in cases with suspected pseudocataplexy or without typical cataplexy. About 85%-95% of individuals with NT1 are positive for the HLA DQB1*06:02 haplotype, supporting an autoimmune pathophysiology.",
        "Functional Consequences of Narcolepsy": "School and work performance are impaired, and individuals should avoid jobs that could endanger themselves or others, like operating machinery or driving buses. Untreated individuals are at risk for social isolation and accidental injury. Social relations may suffer as individuals try to control emotions to avert cataplexy.",

      ],
      "differential_diagnosis": "The idiopathic type is diagnosed by excluding lung diseases, skeletal malformations, and other medical or neurological disorders. It must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia. It is differentiated from other breathing-related sleep disorders by more sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather than the periodic episodes seen in obstructive or central sleep apnea.",
      "comorbidity": "Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs with pulmonary disorders (like COPD), neuromuscular disorders, chest wall disorders, obesity, or medication use (benzodiazepines, opiates). Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is often associated with autonomic dysfunction and Hirschsprung's disease.",
      "full_text": {
        "Subtypes": "Subtypes include Idiopathic hypoventilation, which has no identifiable cause; Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation, a rare genetic disorder manifesting at birth ; and Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation, which is due to other conditions like pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disorders, or obesity.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur independently but more often is comorbid with other medical conditions or substance use. Individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals, morning headaches, and insomnia.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals may present with complaints of insomnia or sleepiness. Morning headaches and episodes of shallow breathing during sleep may be present. Consequences of long-term ventilatory insufficiency can include pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure (cor pulmonale), and neurocognitive dysfunction.",
        "Prevalence": "Idiopathic hypoventilation is very uncommon in adults. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is rare. The comorbid type is more common, with the prevalence of obesity-related hypoventilation estimated at 0.14%-0.6% in the general population.",
        "Development and Course": "Idiopathic hypoventilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder. In comorbid types, the severity reflects the underlying condition. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Use of CNS depressants like benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol can reduce ventilatory drive. The disorder is commonly comorbid with pulmonary, neuromuscular, or chest wall disorders. The congenital form is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Gender distribution reflects that of the comorbid conditions. For example, COPD is more frequent in men. Obesity hypoventilation is now thought to occur equally between genders.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "The disorder is diagnosed using polysomnography, which shows sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The gold standard is documenting an increase in arterial pCO2 levels during sleep. However, this is often impractical, so prolonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation are often used as an indicator.",
        "Functional Consequences of Sleep-Related Hypoventilation": "Consequences are related to chronic hypercapnia and hypoxemia, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale), cognitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.",
        "Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders": "ICSD-3 recognizes six subtypes of sleep hypoventilation disorders. The classifications are similar, though DSM-5 subsumes several ICSD-3 subtypes under the 'comorbid' category."

Sleep terrors involve precipitous awakenings, usually with a panicky scream, intense fear, and autonomic arousal. The individual is difficult to comfort and has amnesia for the event.",
        "Associated Features": "Sleepwalking can include a wide variety of behaviors, from simply sitting up in bed to leaving the house or, rarely, operating machinery. Two specialized forms are sleep-related eating and sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia). In sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread and a compulsion to escape.",
        "Prevalence": "Isolated NREM arousal behaviors are very common. About 10%-30% of children have had at least one sleepwalking episode. The 12-month prevalence of sleepwalking is about 5% in children and 1.0%-7.0% in adults. The prevalence of sleep terror episodes is about 34%-37% at 18-30 months of age and 2.2% in adults.",
        "Development and Course": "These disorders are most common in childhood and usually diminish with age. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors are often outgrown by adolescence. Onset of sleepwalking in adults without a childhood history should prompt a search for other causes like sleep apnea or medication effects.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental factors like sedative use, sleep deprivation, and stress can increase the likelihood of episodes. Genetic and physiological factors are strong; a family history may be present in up to 80% of sleepwalkers. Risk for sleepwalking is as high as 60% in offspring if both parents have a history of it.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Sleep-related eating is more common in women. Sleepwalking is more common in girls during childhood but in men during adulthood. Sleep terrors are more common in boys than girls, but equally common in adult men and women.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Episodes arise from any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly deep slow-wave sleep in the first third of the night. Polysomnography can document episodes but there are no reliable markers to establish a diagnosis in the absence of a recorded event.",
        "Functional Consequences of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders": "For a diagnosis, there must be clinically significant distress or impairment. This can include social embarrassment or, uncommonly, serious injury to the individual or others. Sleep-related eating can lead to weight gain or injury, while sexsomnia can cause serious interpersonal or legal problems.",
        "Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders": "ICSD-3 includes 'confusional arousal, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking' as NREM sleep arousal disorders."

They frequently co-occur with other mental disorders, including PTSD, insomnia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. A concurrent diagnosis is only made when the nightmares warrant independent clinical attention.",
      "full_text": {
        "Recording Procedures": "The specifiers for comorbidity are used to note clinically relevant conditions. When used, the diagnosis is recorded as F51.5 nightmare disorder with the name of the comorbid condition(s), followed by the diagnostic code(s) for those conditions.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "Nightmares are lengthy, elaborate, story-like dreams that seem real and cause anxiety or fear. Their content often focuses on avoiding danger. Upon awakening, nightmares are well-remembered. They almost always arise from REM sleep, making them more likely in the second half of the night. The nightmare usually ends with an awakening and a rapid return to full alertness.",
        "Associated Features": "Mild autonomic arousal may occur. Body movements and vocalizations are not characteristic, as REM sleep is associated with muscle atonia.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence in childhood is approximately 1%-5%. Among adults, 6% have nightmares at least monthly, and 1%-5% have frequent nightmares.",
        "Development and Course": "Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6, peaking in late adolescence or early adulthood. In a minority of cases, frequent nightmares persist into adulthood and can become a lifelong issue.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Risk factors for frequent nightmares in adults include low income, mood disturbance, insomnia, use of antidepressants, and heavy alcohol use. Experiencing past adverse events (not necessarily trauma) is also a risk factor. Twin studies have identified a genetic disposition to nightmares.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The significance of nightmares varies by culture. Among Cambodian refugees, for example, frequent nightmares are strongly associated with PTSD. Among Hmong immigrants, they are more common than in non-Latinx Whites and are associated with traumatic experiences.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Adult women report nightmares more frequently than adult men, though this difference is not found in children or the elderly. Nightmare content also differs by gender, with women reporting themes of sexual harassment or loss, and men reporting themes of physical aggression or war.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Polysomnography shows abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually in the second half of the night. Heart and respiratory rates may increase before awakening.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Individuals with frequent nightmares are at a substantially greater risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior, even after accounting for mental illness.",
        "Functional Consequences of Nightmare Disorder": "Nightmares cause more subjective distress than demonstrable social or occupational impairment. However, frequent awakenings can lead to daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, and mood disturbances.",

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is repeated episodes of vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors that arise from REM sleep. These behaviors, often called 'dream enacting,' frequently reflect responses to action-filled or violent dreams, such as being attacked. This can result in significant injury to the individual or their bed partner. Upon awakening, the person is immediately alert and oriented and can often recall the dream content. The diagnosis typically requires polysomnography showing REM sleep without atonia, or a history suggestive of the disorder in someone with an established synucleinopathy diagnosis like Parkinson's disease.",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is approximately 1% in middle- to older-age general population samples and about 2% in elderly samples. One study found no gender difference in prevalence.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset can be gradual or rapid. Due to the high association with future neurodegenerative disorders, individuals should be closely monitored neurologically. The risk of developing a defined neurodegenerative disease is about 75% within 10-15 years after diagnosis.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "A study of Chinese individuals in Taiwan found similar clinical characteristics to non-Latinx Whites in the U.S., but with a higher rate of nocturnal wandering and a lower rate of sleep-related injuries, possibly due to earlier detection by family members.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is more common in men over 50, but is increasingly identified in women and younger individuals. Women tend to have a younger age at onset and diagnosis.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Polysomnography shows increased muscle activity (loss of atonia) during REM sleep. This finding, known as REM sleep without atonia, is present in virtually all cases.",
        "Functional Consequences of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder": "The most serious consequences are the short-term risk of injury from dream enactment and the long-term risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 55% of individuals may experience injury, with 12% being serious.",

These symptoms begin or worsen during rest, are relieved by movement, and are worse in the evening or at night. For a diagnosis, symptoms must occur at least three times a week for at least 3 months and cause significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis is based mainly on self-report.",
        "Associated Features": "Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) are seen in up to 90% of individuals with RLS and can serve as corroborating evidence. A positive family history and a reduction in symptoms with dopaminergic treatment are also supportive features.",
        "Prevalence": "When defined as occurring at least three times a week with moderate to severe distress, the prevalence is 1.6% in the U.S. and Europe. It is about twice as common in women as in men and increases with age.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset is typically in the second or third decade, but about 40% of adults with RLS report symptoms starting before age 20. Familial RLS usually has a younger age of onset and a slower progression. Diagnosis in children can be difficult due to the reliance on self-report.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Predisposing factors include female sex, advancing age, and a family history. Iron deficiency can be a precipitating factor. Genome-wide studies have identified multiple associated genetic variants, particularly in the MEIS1 gene. Pathophysiology may also involve disturbances in central dopamine and opioid systems, and iron metabolism.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence appears to be lower in some Latin American and Asian populations compared to those of European ancestry.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "RLS is more prevalent in women, but there are no diagnostic differences by gender. The prevalence during pregnancy is two to three times higher than in the general population.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Polysomnography can show increased sleep latency and a higher arousal index. Periodic limb movements are the motor sign of RLS and are usually present on overnight polysomnography.",

      "comorbidity": "Refer to comorbidity sections for other sleep disorders in the chapter.",
      "full_text": {
        "Recording Procedures": "The name of the disorder starts with the specific substance causing the sleep disturbance. The ICD-10-CM code is selected based on the substance class and whether a comorbid substance use disorder is present. If a use disorder is present, it is recorded first, followed by the induced sleep disorder. For example, 'severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disorder'.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is a prominent and severe sleep disturbance judged to be caused by the pharmacological effects of a substance (drug of abuse, medication, or toxin). The disturbance can be insomnia, daytime sleepiness, a parasomnia, or a combination. The diagnosis is made instead of substance intoxication or withdrawal only when the sleep symptoms are predominant and severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention. The disorder is distinguished from a non-substance-induced sleep disorder by considering its onset and course in relation to substance use.",
        "Associated Features by Substance": "\u2022 Alcohol: Typically causes insomnia. Acute intoxication has a sedative effect initially, but is followed by restless, fragmented sleep in the second half of the night. Withdrawal is associated with extremely disrupted sleep and increased REM sleep .\n\u2022 Caffeine: Can produce insomnia in a dose- and timing-dependent manner, especially when taken late in the day .\n\u2022 Cannabis: Acute use may shorten sleep latency and enhance slow-wave sleep, but tolerance develops with chronic use. Withdrawal can lead to sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams .\n\u2022 Opioids: May increase sleepiness initially, but tolerance develops with continued use, leading to insomnia complaints. They can also exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea and cause central sleep apnea .\n\u2022 Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics: These drugs increase sleepiness during acute intoxication. Chronic use can lead to tolerance and rebound insomnia upon withdrawal. Parasomnias like sleepwalking have been associated with some of these drugs .\n\u2022 Stimulants (Amphetamines, Cocaine, MDMA): Characterized by insomnia during intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal. Acute use reduces total sleep and REM sleep .\n\u2022 Tobacco: Chronic use is associated with insomnia, decreased slow-wave sleep, and increased daytime sleepiness.",
        "Development and Course": "In children and adolescents, insomnia or other sleep disturbances should prompt consideration of substance use. Older individuals are at increased risk due to taking more medications.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Individuals with pre-existing vulnerability to insomnia may be at higher risk for developing a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Males and females can have different sleep-related outcomes from the same substance due to sex-specific differences in factors like hepatic functioning.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Polysomnography can help define the severity of the sleep complaint, and MSLT can assess daytime sleepiness. Sleep diaries, actigraphy, and drug screening can also be helpful.",
        "Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder": "A unique consequence is an increased risk for relapse of the substance use. The degree of sleep disturbance during alcohol withdrawal, for example, predicts the risk of relapse.",
        "Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders": "ICSD-3 lists sleep disorders 'due to a medication or substance' under their respective phenotypes (e.g., hypersomnia) but does not have a separate diagnosis for 'insomnia due to a medication or substance'."

        "Associated Features": "Men and their partners may report prolonged thrusting to the point of exhaustion or discomfort. Some men may avoid sexual activity altogether. The disorder is associated with highly frequent masturbation, specific masturbation techniques not easily replicated by a partner, and disparity between masturbatory fantasies and reality. Men with delayed ejaculation often report less coital activity, higher relationship distress, and lower sexual satisfaction. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of delayed ejaculation in the U.S. is estimated at 1%-5%, but has ranged up to 11% in international studies.",
        "Development and Course": "Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with the first sexual experiences, while the acquired type begins after a period of normal function. The prevalence of delayed ejaculation increases with age. Aging is associated with reduced ejaculatory volume and force, and increased refractory time.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Depression and relationship dissatisfaction are predominant psychosocial contributors. Numerous medical conditions can lead to delayed ejaculation, such as radical prostatectomy, neurological and endocrine disorders, and diabetes. Medications like tamsulosin, antihypertensives, and antidepressants can also cause it. Age-related loss of peripheral sensory nerves and decreased sex steroid secretion may also contribute.",

      "comorbidity": "Women with female orgasmic disorder may also have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal difficulties. Co-occurring major depressive disorder may indirectly increase the likelihood of orgasm difficulties through its impact on sexual interest and arousal.",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing orgasm or a marked reduction in the intensity of orgasmic sensations. These symptoms must be experienced on almost all occasions of sexual activity, persist for at least 6 months, and cause clinically significant distress. Women vary widely in the type of stimulation that elicits orgasm, and many require clitoral stimulation; an inability to orgasm from intercourse alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Difficulties due to inadequate sexual stimulation also do not warrant a diagnosis.",
        "Associated Features": "Orgasm difficulties in women often co-occur with problems related to sexual interest and arousal. Despite a lack of strong correlation between orgasm and overall sexual satisfaction, some women may have difficulty communicating about sexual issues. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "Reported prevalence rates for orgasm problems in premenopausal women vary widely, from 8% to 72%. However, only a portion of these women also report associated distress. Internationally, about 10% of women have never experienced an orgasm in their lifetime.",
        "Development and Course": "Lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that orgasm difficulties have always been present. A woman's first orgasm can occur at any time from prepuberty to adulthood, and reports of experiencing orgasm increase with age. Many women learn to experience orgasm through experience and increased knowledge of their bodies.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors like anxiety can interfere with orgasm. Environmental factors like relationship problems and sociocultural norms are also important influences. Physiological factors include medical conditions like multiple sclerosis and pelvic nerve damage, as well as medications like SSRIs. There may also be a significant genetic contribution to female orgasmic function.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The degree to which lack of orgasm is seen as a problem varies by culture. Cultural views that devalue female sexual satisfaction can lead to lower help-seeking. There are marked sociocultural and generational differences in women's orgasmic ability.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "By definition, this diagnosis is only given to women. Distressing orgasm difficulties in men are considered under delayed ejaculation.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "The diagnosis is based on a woman's self-report, as there is significant variability in physiological indicators of orgasm.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Dysfunctions of sexual arousal and satisfaction have been linked to suicidal thoughts among female veterans and military service members.",
        "Functional Consequences of Female Orgasmic Disorder": "The functional consequences are unclear. While there is a strong association between relationship problems and orgasm difficulties, the causal direction is uncertain."

        "Diagnostic Features": "To be diagnosed, a woman must have a lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal, as shown by at least three of six specific indicators (e.g., absent interest in sexual activity, absent sexual thoughts, no initiation of sex). A simple desire discrepancy with a partner is not enough for a diagnosis. Symptoms must persist for about 6 months and cause clinically significant distress. Short-term changes in interest/arousal are common and not considered a dysfunction. A diagnosis is not made if the lack of desire is better explained by self-identification as 'asexual'.",
        "Associated Features": "The disorder is often associated with problems experiencing orgasm, pain during sex, infrequent sexual activity, and relationship difficulties. Unrealistic expectations and lack of information about sexuality may also be evident. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "Approximately 30% of women experience chronic low desire, with about half of them reporting significant partner-related distress and a quarter reporting personal distress. Prevalence estimates vary markedly by age, culture, and whether distress is considered. When distress is required for diagnosis, prevalence estimates are much lower.",
        "Development and Course": "The lifelong subtype indicates the problem has been present for the woman's entire sexual life, while the acquired subtype develops after a period of normal functioning. Normative changes in sexual functioning occur across the lifespan and with relationship duration.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors include negative cognitions about sexuality and a history of mental disorders. Environmental factors include relationship difficulties and childhood stressors. Genetic factors appear to have a strong influence. Physiological factors include medical conditions like diabetes and thyroid dysfunction.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Reported prevalence of low desire varies across world regions, from 26% to 43%. Cultural norms and expectations for sexual behavior must be considered when making a diagnosis.",

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder involves a combination of four symptom dimensions: 1) difficulty with vaginal penetration during intercourse; 2) marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during penetration; 3) marked fear or anxiety about this pain; and 4) marked tensing of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted penetration. A diagnosis can be made if only one of these symptom dimensions is present, as long as it causes significant distress and has persisted for about 6 months. The disorder encompasses what was previously known as dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and vaginismus (involuntary muscle contraction preventing penetration).",
        "Associated Features": "The disorder is frequently associated with other sexual dysfunctions, particularly reduced sexual desire and interest. Behavioral avoidance of sexual situations and gynecological exams is common, similar to a phobic disorder. Women may experience relationship problems and diminished feelings of femininity. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is unknown, but approximately 10%-28% of reproductive-age women in the U.S. report recurrent pain during intercourse. Internationally, prevalence ranges from 8% to 28%.",
        "Development and Course": "It can be difficult to characterize the disorder as lifelong or acquired. Difficulty with or avoidance of tampon use can be an early clinical sign. Once symptoms are present for about 6 months, spontaneous remission is less likely. Complaints of genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and around menopause.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Antecedent mood and anxiety disorders are risk factors. A history of sexual or physical abuse is a risk factor, though not all women with the disorder have this history. A history of vaginal infections can precede the onset of pain. Abnormalities of the pelvic floor muscles, such as hypertonicity, can also contribute.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cultural contexts can affect the experience and reporting of genito-pelvic pain. Cultural views that devalue female sexual experience may lead to lower help-seeking. In the U.S., Hispanic women report significantly higher rates of this pain compared to non-Hispanic women.",

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "For a diagnosis, there must be a persistent or recurrent lack of both sexual desire and sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies. A simple desire discrepancy with a partner is not sufficient. Symptoms must be present for at least 6 months. These duration and severity criteria are intended to distinguish the disorder from temporary, reactive low desire.",
        "Associated Features": "The disorder is sometimes associated with erectile and/or ejaculatory concerns. Men with the disorder often do not initiate sexual activity and are unreceptive to a partner's advances. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence estimates in representative samples range from 3% to 17%. Problems are less common in younger men (3%-14%) compared to older men aged 60-74 (16%-28%). However, a persistent lack of interest lasting 6 months or more affects a smaller proportion of men (6%), and less than 2% report clinically significant distress associated with it.",
        "Development and Course": "The lifelong subtype indicates low desire has always been present, while the acquired subtype develops after a period of normal desire. There is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire, with prevalence of low desire increasing from about 5.2% at age 27 to 18.5% at age 50.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors like mood and anxiety symptoms are strong predictors of low desire. Restrictive sexual attitudes are also associated with low desire. Environmental factors include alcohol use, problematic relationships, and professional stress. Physiological risk factors include endocrine disorders like hypogonadism and simply age itself.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence rates of low desire vary across world regions, from 12.5% in Northern Europe to 28% in Southeast Asia for men aged 40-80.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Desire and arousal disorders are separate in men, unlike in women. Men generally report higher frequency and intensity of sexual desire than women. Low sexual desire is reported more commonly by gay men (19%) than heterosexual men (9%)."

        "Diagnostic Features": "The core feature is a persistent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within about 1 minute of vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. While specified for penile-vaginal sex, it's assumed to apply to other sexual activities. The diagnosis relies on self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency, which are generally sufficient.",
        "Associated Features": "Men with this disorder often complain of a lack of control over ejaculation and experience apprehension about future sexual encounters. Assessment should consider partner, relationship, individual, cultural/religious, and medical factors.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence estimates vary widely from 8%-30% internationally. When defined strictly as ejaculation within 1 minute of penetration, only 1%-3% of men would be diagnosed.",
        "Development and Course": "Lifelong premature ejaculation begins with initial sexual experiences and persists. The acquired form develops after a period of normal ejaculatory function, likely with a later onset, often after the fourth decade of life. Persistence of the problem for over 6 months is key to diagnosis.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental factors include a higher prevalence in men with anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety. Genetic and physiological factors show a moderate genetic contribution to the lifelong type, possibly associated with dopamine or serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms. Acquired PE is associated with conditions like thyroid disease and prostatitis.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Perceptions of normal ejaculatory latency differ cross-culturally. Reports were more common in arranged marriages, possibly due to family pressure and lack of premarital sexual experience.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "This is a sexual dysfunction in men. Men and their partners may have different perceptions of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "In clinical settings, the man's self-estimated time to ejaculation is accepted for diagnosis.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Among men being treated for premature ejaculation with comorbid depression, elevated rates of suicidal thoughts or behavior have been observed.",
        "Functional Consequences of Premature (Early) Ejaculation": "The disorder can lead to decreased self-esteem, a sense of lack of control, and adverse effects on partner relationships. It may also cause distress for the partner. Ejaculation before penetration can lead to difficulties with conception."

If a comorbid substance use disorder exists, it is listed first (e.g., 'severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction'). A separate diagnosis for the comorbid use disorder is not given.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is a clinically significant sexual dysfunction that is judged to be caused by the effects of a substance, such as a drug of abuse or a medication. The symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal, or after exposure to a medication. The diagnosis should not be given if the dysfunction is better explained by an independent sexual disorder, such as if symptoms preceded substance use or persist for more than a month after stopping.",
        "Associated Features": "Sexual dysfunctions can be associated with intoxication from alcohol, opioids, sedatives, and stimulants. They can also occur during withdrawal from these substances. Medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives are known to induce sexual dysfunctions. Antidepressants most commonly cause difficulty with orgasm or ejaculation, with certain agents like SSRIs having the highest rates. Antipsychotics can also cause problems with desire, erection, and orgasm. Illicit substance use, chronic alcohol, and nicotine abuse are also associated with sexual dysfunction.",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is unclear due to underreporting of treatment-emergent side effects. For antidepressants, prevalence varies by agent, with some studies showing 25%-80% of individuals reporting sexual side effects. About 50% of individuals on antipsychotics experience adverse sexual side effects.",
        "Development and Course": "Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction can start as early as 8 days after beginning the medication. About 30% of individuals with mild to moderate orgasm delay may experience spontaneous remission within 6 months. In some cases, SSRI-induced dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. Premature ejaculation can sometimes occur after stopping opioid use.",

        "Development and Course": "Onset of gender-nonconforming behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4. The expression of 'anatomic dysphoria' (discomfort with one's sexual anatomy) becomes more common as children approach puberty. For a percentage of children, gender dysphoria persists into adolescence and adulthood, with persistence rates in clinic-referred samples ranging from 2% to 39% for individuals assigned male at birth and 12% to 50% for individuals assigned female at birth. For those whose gender dysphoria does not persist, a majority later self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Greater intensity of gender nonconformity and older age at presentation make persistence of gender dysphoria more likely. For children assigned male at birth, having older brothers is more common compared to cisgender males. Some genetic contribution is suggested by familiality and twin studies.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder has been reported across many countries and cultures. Coexisting mental health problems may differ among cultures, potentially related to societal attitudes toward gender nonconformity.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "In children, referrals to specialty clinics show a higher ratio of individuals assigned male at birth to individuals assigned female at birth, ranging from 1.25:1 to 4.3:1.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "A study found that gender-referred children were 8.6 times more likely to self-harm or attempt suicide than comparison children.",
        "Functional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria": "Gender nonconformity in children may interfere with daily activities, affect peer relationships, lead to isolation, and cause distress. Many children experience teasing and harassment, especially in nonsupportive environments."

      "comorbidity": "Autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria than in the general population. They also often have high rates of other mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common. Those who have experienced harassment and violence may also develop PTSD.",

The 'posttransition' specifier may be used for individuals who have transitioned to full-time living in their experienced gender and are undergoing or have undergone gender-affirming medical procedures.",
        "Diagnostic Features": "The core feature is a marked incongruence between the assigned gender and the experienced/expressed gender, which can include alternative gender identities beyond the binary. This discrepancy is often accompanied by a desire to be rid of one's sex characteristics and/or acquire those of another gender. Individuals may adopt the behavior and clothing of their experienced gender and feel uncomfortable being regarded by others as their assigned gender. Some may resolve this incongruence by living in the desired role without seeking medical treatment.",
        "Associated Features": "Adolescents assigned male at birth may shave facial and body hair and bind their genitals; those assigned female at birth may bind their breasts. They may seek out gender-affirming hormones or surgery. Adults with an aversion to their genitals may constrain their sexual activity. An overrepresentation of autism spectrum traits is observed in this group. Before gender-affirming treatment, adolescents and adults are at increased risk for mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts.",
        "Prevalence": "While precise population data are lacking, surveys suggest self-identification as transgender ranges from 0.5% to 0.6%, with the desire to undergo medical treatment ranging from 0.2% to 0.6%.",
        "Development and Course": "Incongruence between experienced and assigned gender is a central feature for adolescents and adults. Distress may be mitigated by supportive environments. Impairment, including school refusal, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, may be a correlate of the disorder. Two developmental trajectories exist: prepubertal-onset and late-onset. The late-onset type occurs around or after puberty, and these individuals may not recall any childhood signs of gender dysphoria.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "For individuals with postpubertal onset, a history of transvestism that develops into autogynephilia (sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as a woman) may be a predisposing factor. Some genetic contribution is suggested by familiality and twin studies.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder has been reported across many countries and cultures, some of which have institutionalized gender categories other than man/woman.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Recent studies show increasing numbers of adolescents presenting to clinics, with a shift to a greater number of individuals assigned female at birth than male. In adults, estimates generally suggest more individuals assigned male at birth seek treatment, with ratios from 1:1 to 6.1:1.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Rates of suicidality are high, ranging from 30% to 80%. Adolescents referred to gender clinics have substantially higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than non-referred peers. After gender-affirming treatment, suicide risk may persist for some. Among adolescents, the highest rate of suicide attempts is among transgender young men.",
        "Functional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria": "The distress from gender incongruence often interferes with daily activities. Relationship difficulties and impairment at school or work are common. The disorder is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization, which can lead to negative self-concept, depression, suicidality, and economic marginalization."

It is also commonly seen with other substance use disorders, particularly tobacco use disorder.  Alcohol-induced conditions, like depression or anxiety disorders, can also occur. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical symptoms, such as withdrawal, tolerance, and craving.  Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after reducing heavy, prolonged intake.  To avoid withdrawal, individuals may continue drinking despite adverse consequences.  Intense craving for alcohol can make it difficult to think of anything else.  The disorder can lead to neglect of major responsibilities at school, work, or home ; use in hazardous situations ; and continued use despite knowing it causes physical or psychological problems. ",
        "Associated Features": "This disorder is often associated with problems related to other substances like cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and sedatives.  Symptoms of conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes precede it.  Repeated high-dose intake can affect nearly every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specific health issues include gastritis, ulcers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, increased cancer rates, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy.  Neurological effects can include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), and degenerative changes.  The disorder is also a significant contributor to suicide risk. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among adults is 29.1% (8.6% mild, 6.6% moderate, 13.9% severe).  Australian lifetime prevalence is 31.0%.  U.S. rates are higher in men (36.0%) than women (22.7%).  For DSM-IV criteria, the 12-month prevalence was 4.6% for ages 12-17, 16.2% for ages 18-29, and 1.5% for those 65 and older.  Rates vary by ethnoracial group, with Native Americans having high rates and Asian Americans having lower rates. ",
        "Development and Course": "The first episode of alcohol intoxication is likely to occur during the mid-teens.  Alcohol use disorder typically has an onset in the late teens or early to mid-20s.  The majority of individuals who develop the disorder do so by their late 30s.  The course is variable, characterized by periods of remission and relapse.  A decision to stop drinking is often followed by abstinence, but a return to drinking is highly likely to escalate.  Late-onset of the disorder (after age 40) occurs in about 10% of cases.  Older adults are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol due to age-related physical changes. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental risk factors include poverty, discrimination, unemployment, cultural attitudes, alcohol availability, and stress levels.  Heavier peer substance use and certain coping styles also contribute.  Genetic influences account for 40%-60% of the risk variance, with a 3-4 times higher rate in close relatives.  A low level of response to alcohol is a specific risk factor, while an acute skin flush reaction (more common in persons of Asian descent) is associated with low risk.  High levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier onset and more severe course. ",
        "Culture-Related Issues": "Alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating substance in most cultures, contributing to 2.8 million deaths globally in 2016.  Prevalence is highest in the European and American regions.  For immigrants to the U.S., greater acculturation is linked to a higher prevalence of the disorder.  Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, common in individuals of Asian descent, can be protective against the disorder but may be modulated by sociocultural factors.  The diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most U.S. race/ethnicity groups. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Issues": "Men have higher rates of drinking and the disorder than women, but the gender gap is narrowing.  Females typically develop higher blood alcohol levels per drink and may be more vulnerable to some physical consequences like liver disease.  Environmental risk factors may differ by sex.  Drinking during pregnancy may be a sign of the disorder. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Blood alcohol concentration can confirm recent use and indicate tolerance if an individual shows little intoxication at high levels (e.g., >150 mg/dL).  Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) are sensitive lab indicators of heavy drinking and can be used to monitor abstinence.  An elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can also indicate heavy drinking.  Other nonspecific markers include elevated triglycerides and uric acid.  Physical signs can include dyspepsia, hepatomegaly, tremor, unsteady gait, and insomnia. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Acute and chronic heavy alcohol use are associated with suicide.  A meta-analysis found that acute alcohol use was associated with a nearly sevenfold increase in risk of a suicide attempt, with heavier use conferring greater risk.  Co-use with sedatives further increases this risk.  Alcohol use is also associated with a higher likelihood of using firearms in a suicide. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder": "The disorder impairs functioning in areas such as driving, school, work, relationships, and health.  It contributes to work absenteeism, accidents, and low productivity.  The disorder is associated with a significant increase in the risk of accidents, violence, and suicide, accounting for up to 55% of fatal driving events and being linked to criminal acts like homicide.

Early in a session, stimulating effects like talkativeness may occur, while later, depressant and cognitive impairment effects emerge as levels fall.  Amnesia for events during intoxication ('blackouts') can happen at high blood alcohol levels.  At very high blood alcohol levels (>300-400 mg/dL), intoxication can be fatal in nontolerant individuals.  Intoxication is a major contributor to interpersonal violence and suicidal behavior. ",
        "Prevalence": "A large majority of alcohol consumers have likely been intoxicated at some point.  In 2018, 17.5% of U.S. 12th graders reported being drunk in the prior 30 days.  The 12-month prevalence of high-risk drinking varies by ethnoracial group, from 7.2% for Asians and Pacific Islanders to 17.4% for Native Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "Intoxication is an episode lasting several hours.  The average age of first intoxication in the U.S. is about 15, with prevalence peaking between 18-25 years.  Earlier onset of regular intoxication predicts a greater likelihood of developing alcohol use disorder. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Personality traits like sensation-seeking and impulsivity increase risk.  Environmental factors include having heavy-drinking peers and using alcohol to cope with stress. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cultural acceptance of drunkenness varies, with some college groups encouraging it and some religious groups discouraging it. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Historically, intoxication was more tolerated in men, but this gender gap may be narrowing.  Women are generally less tolerant of the same amount of alcohol than men. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Intoxication is usually established by behavior and smelling alcohol on the breath.  Blood or breath alcohol levels can confirm use. ",

Cannabis is used in many forms, including smoking, vaping, dabbing, and edibles, with widely varying potency.  The disorder is defined by a cluster of 11 behavioral and physical symptoms leading to impairment, including withdrawal, tolerance, craving, and hazardous use.  Regular users develop tolerance, and cessation can lead to a withdrawal syndrome.  Continued use despite negative impacts on relationships or activities is a key marker of a severe disorder. ",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals often use cannabis to cope with mood, insomnia, or pain.  Chronic use can produce a lack of motivation resembling persistent depressive disorder.  Physical signs can include red eyes, cannabis odor, yellowed fingertips, and chronic cough. ",

Prevalence is highest among ages 18-29 (6.9%).  Rates are higher in men than women.  Among ethnoracial groups, rates are highest in American Indians/Alaska Natives and African Americans.  Only 7%-8% of adults with the disorder receive treatment. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset is most common in adolescence or young adulthood.  The disorder generally develops over an extended period, though progression may be faster in adolescents with conduct problems.  Early onset (before age 15) is a robust predictor of developing this and other substance use disorders.  Among adults, the disorder often involves well-established patterns of daily use. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risk factors include a history of conduct disorder and other externalizing or internalizing disorders.  Environmental risks include unstable family situations, childhood abuse, low socioeconomic status, and ease of availability.  Living in a U.S. state with legal recreational marijuana increases the risk for adults.  Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the risk. ",

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder applies to phencyclidine (PCP) and pharmacologically similar substances like ketamine.  These drugs were first developed as dissociative anesthetics and produce feelings of separation from mind and body.  They are typically smoked or taken orally, but can also be snorted or injected.  The primary psychoactive effects of PCP last a few hours, but elimination from the body can take 8 days or longer.  The hallucinogenic effects can last for weeks and may precipitate a persistent psychotic episode.  Withdrawal symptoms have not been clearly established in humans, so the withdrawal criterion is not included in this diagnosis. ",
        "Associated Features": "Urine tests can detect phencyclidine for up to 8 days or longer after high doses.  Intoxication symptoms that can aid diagnosis include dissociative symptoms, analgesia, nystagmus, hypertension, and hallucinations.  Violent behavior can also occur, as intoxicated individuals may feel they are being attacked. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is believed to be low, based on the overall low rates of hallucinogen use disorder (around 0.1% in the U.S.).  Only 0.3% of U.S. substance use treatment admissions endorse phencyclidine as their primary drug. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "One Australian study found ketamine users were more likely to be men and to have consumed more than 11 standard drinks per day. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The gender ratio is unknown, but among U.S. treatment admissions for primary phencyclidine use, 62% were men. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Urine toxicology testing is useful.  Physical signs like nystagmus, analgesia, and hypertension can help distinguish phencyclidine intoxication from that of other hallucinogens. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder": "Individuals may have physical injuries from accidents, fights, and falls.  Chronic use can lead to acute and persistent cognitive impairment, as well as urinary tract, intestinal, cardiac, and respiratory problems. "

        "Prevalence": "This disorder is rare, with a 12-month prevalence of about 0.1% in the U.S. population age 12 and older.  The rate is highest among those aged 18-25 (0.4%).  However, prevalence is much higher in clinical samples and among heavy users. ",

        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include high sensation-seeking.  Environmental risks in the U.S. include higher income, lower education, being unmarried, and living in urban areas.  Early onset of use is also a risk factor.  Genetic factors contribute an estimated 26% to 79% of the total variance in risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Some hallucinogens, like peyote and ayahuasca, are used in established religious or spiritual practices and should be considered within that cultural context. ",

Features include recurrent use despite serious problems, failure to fulfill major obligations, continued use despite social problems, and use in hazardous situations.  Tolerance is reported by about 10% of users.  A clinically significant withdrawal syndrome has not been established, so it is not a diagnostic criterion, although symptoms may occur. ",
        "Associated Features": "The diagnosis is supported by recurring intoxication episodes with negative standard drug screens, possession of inhalants, a 'glue-sniffer's rash' around the nose or mouth, and association with other users.

        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include sensation seeking and impulsivity.  Environmental risks include the wide availability of inhalants and a history of childhood maltreatment or trauma.  Genetic and physiological risk is linked to behavioral disinhibition, a highly heritable trait. ",

It consists of compulsive, prolonged self-administration for non-medical purposes or in excess of prescribed amounts.  Most individuals with the disorder have tolerance and experience withdrawal upon cessation.  Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (craving) contribute to relapse and persist long after withdrawal.  Daily activities are often planned around obtaining and using opioids.  Prescription opioids may be obtained illicitly, and healthcare professionals may divert drugs for their own use. ",
        "Associated Features": "Opioid overdose, characterized by unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils, can be fatal and has increased exponentially in the U.S. since 1999.

      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This class includes benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related drugs.  These brain depressants can produce disorders similar to those from alcohol.  The disorder can arise from both prescribed and illicitly obtained substances.  Craving is a typical feature.  Misuse often occurs with other substances, such as using benzodiazepines to 'come down' from stimulants.  The disorder can lead to failure to fulfill major role obligations and continued use despite social or interpersonal problems.  Significant tolerance and withdrawal can develop.  However, tolerance and withdrawal that occur during appropriate medical use do not count toward the diagnosis unless other criteria are met. ",
        "Associated Features": "Often associated with other substance use disorders.  With repeated use, tolerance develops to sedative effects, but tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly, increasing the risk of fatal respiratory depression with dose escalation.  Intense intoxication can lead to severe, temporary depression and suicide attempts. ",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of the DSM-IV disorder in the U.S. is about 0.3% for both adolescents and adults.  Prevalence is highest among those aged 18-29 (0.5%).  Rates do not consistently vary by gender in the U.S., but some international studies show higher rates in women. ",
        "Development and Course": "One common course involves escalation of use in teens or young adults, often alongside other substance use disorders.  Another course begins with a legitimate prescription, followed by dose escalation due to tolerance or perceived need.  Onset is typically in adolescence or early adulthood, with risk for misuse decreasing after age 30.  However, older individuals are more susceptible to side effects like cognitive impairment and falls. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include impulsivity and novelty-seeking.  Environmental risks relate to the availability of the drugs through prescriptions.  Genetic factors play an important role.  Early onset of use is associated with a greater likelihood of developing the disorder. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prescription patterns vary across countries, which may affect prevalence.  In the U.S., benzodiazepine use is more frequently reported by non-Latinx Whites, but the risk of developing the disorder may be higher in other groups like African Americans once use is initiated. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "There appear to be no gender differences in the prevalence of the disorder. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Most of these substances can be identified in urine or blood tests.  Urine tests may remain positive for up to a week for long-acting substances. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "U.S. epidemiological studies show an association between hypnotics and suicide, but it is unclear if this is due to underlying conditions like depression and insomnia, which are also suicide risk factors. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder": "Consequences are similar to alcohol use disorder, with potential for accidents, interpersonal difficulties, and work/school impairment.  Overdoses can be lethal, especially when mixed with other depressants like alcohol or opioids.  Intravenous use carries risks of infections like hepatitis and HIV. "

Cardiopulmonary problems are often present in individuals seeking treatment. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This class includes amphetamine-type substances (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate) and cocaine.  The disorder can develop rapidly, sometimes within a week of exposure.  Tolerance occurs with repeated use, and withdrawal symptoms (dysphoria, fatigue, unpleasant dreams) can enhance craving.  Amphetamine-type substances are longer-acting than cocaine.  High-dose use can lead to aggressive behavior, intense anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychotic episodes.  Withdrawal from stimulants can cause temporary but intense depressive symptoms. ",
        "Associated Features": "When injected or smoked, stimulants produce an instant feeling of well-being and euphoria.  Chronic use can lead to chaotic behavior, social isolation, and aggression.  Intoxication may present with rambling speech, paranoia, and tactile hallucinations.  Withdrawal is associated with depression, suicidal thoughts, anhedonia, and irritability.  These mental disturbances usually resolve within hours to days but can persist for a month. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the U.S., the 12-month prevalence of amphetamine-type substance use disorder is 0.4%, and for cocaine use disorder, it is also 0.4%.  Rates are highest among individuals aged 18-25.  Rates are higher for men than women for both substance types. ",
        "Development and Course": "Use patterns can be chronic or episodic, with binges of continuous high-dose use over hours or days.  Smoking and intravenous use are associated with a more rapid progression to a severe use disorder.  Some individuals begin use to control weight or improve performance. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder.  Environmental risks include prenatal cocaine exposure and exposure to community violence or childhood mistreatment.  Men who have sex with men are at higher risk for methamphetamine use. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence and admission rates for treatment vary among ethnoracial groups in the U.S., which may reflect differential access to care, criminalization, and other social factors. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women with cocaine use disorder more frequently have comorbid depression and PTSD.  Gonadal hormones may affect responses to cocaine, with higher progesterone levels in women being associated with lower craving. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine for 1-3 days (up to 7-12 days in heavy users).  Amphetamine-type substances can be detected for 1-4 days.  Hair samples can detect use for up to 90 days. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Regular amphetamine use is associated with increased suicide mortality.  Cocaine use disorder is linked to higher rates of suicidal thoughts.  Both cocaine and amphetamine use disorders were associated with increased suicide deaths in a study of U.S. veterans. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Stimulant Use Disorder": "Medical conditions vary by route of administration. 'Snorting' can damage the nasal mucosa, smoking can cause respiratory problems, and injecting carries risks of HIV and hepatitis.  Weight loss and malnutrition are common.  Cardiac events like myocardial infarction and stroke can occur even in young, healthy individuals.  Neurocognitive impairment is common, and chronic use can cause neurotoxicity.

It also increases perinatal problems like low birth weight.  Psychiatric comorbidities are common, especially with alcohol and other substance use disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and ADHD.  Individuals with a psychiatric disorder are three times more likely to have tobacco use disorder. ",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder can develop with use of all forms of tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes) and prescription nicotine.  The addictive potential is associated with the rapidity of nicotine delivery (smoked > oral > transdermal).  Tolerance is shown by the disappearance of nausea after initial use and the more intense effect of the first use of the day.  Cessation produces a clear withdrawal syndrome, and many use tobacco to relieve or avoid these symptoms.  The criteria for time spent obtaining the substance or failure to fulfill role obligations are less commonly endorsed for tobacco than for other substances due to its legal and accessible nature. ",
        "Associated Features": "Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, smoking daily, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with the disorder.  Serious medical conditions are common, as are symptoms like coughing and accelerated skin aging. ",
        "Prevalence": "In the U.S., 19% of adults used a tobacco product in the last year.  The 12-month prevalence of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder was 20% among U.S. adults, with rates varying significantly by ethnoracial group (from 11.2% in Asian Americans to 29.6% in Native Americans).  Prevalence is higher among men and those with lower income or education.  The prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50%. ",
        "Development and Course": "About 20% of U.S. high school seniors have tried cigarettes, with most daily users starting by that age.  Initiation after age 21 is rare.  Addiction can begin soon after initial use, but fulfilling full criteria for the disorder usually takes several years. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include externalizing personality traits.  Having other psychiatric disorders like ADHD, depression, or anxiety increases the risk.  Environmental risks include low income and low educational levels.  Genetic factors contribute about 50% of the heritability. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence varies greatly by geographic region, from 4.7% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 24.2% in Eastern Europe.  Higher prevalence is associated with exposure to racism and ethnic discrimination. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The ratio of male to female smokers in the U.S. is about 1.4:1.  Negative reinforcement (smoking to relieve negative affect) may be a stronger motivator in women.  Pregnant females smoke at a lower rate but relapse quickly after delivery. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Biomarkers like carbon monoxide in breath and cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine can measure use but are only weakly associated with the disorder itself. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Past-year cigarette use is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Tobacco use disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicide, even after adjusting for covariates. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder": "Half of smokers who do not quit will die early from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in more than one-half of tobacco users.  Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. "

        "Associated Features": "Diagnosis is supported by reported use of a substance not in the other classes or by recurring intoxication with negative results on standard drug screens.  Misuse of nitrous oxide may be seen in medical/dental professionals and food service workers due to access.  Misuse by youth is significant and can lead to serious medical complications.  There is no evidence of unique suicide risk factors for this category. ",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence is likely lower than for the other nine substance classes.  While use of some of these substances is not rare (e.g., lifetime prevalence of nitrous oxide use is 4.6% in the U.S.), how often this use qualifies for a disorder is unknown. ",

It is defined by a cluster of four or more specific symptoms within a 12-month period.  A pattern of 'chasing one's losses' with an urgent need to continue gambling is characteristic.  Individuals may lie to conceal their involvement and may engage in 'bailout' behavior, seeking financial help from others. ",
        "Associated Features": "Distortions in thinking (e.g., superstitions, overconfidence) are common.  Many individuals believe money is both the cause and solution to their problems.  Some are impulsive and easily bored, while others are depressed and lonely. ",
        "Prevalence": "The past-year prevalence is about 0.2%-0.3% in the general U.S. population.  The lifetime prevalence is about 0.4%-1.0%.  It is more common in men (0.6%) than women (0.2%).  Prevalence varies among ethnoracial groups, with the highest rates in African Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset can be in adolescence or adulthood, with progression being more rapid in women than men.  Most individuals show a pattern of gradually increasing frequency and amount of wagering.  Gambling patterns can be regular or episodic.  The disorder is more common in younger and middle-aged individuals than older adults. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Gambling that begins in childhood is associated with higher rates of the disorder.  The disorder aggregates with antisocial personality disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and alcohol use disorder.  Genetic and environmental factors both contribute. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Types of gambling activities vary across cultures.  Some Indigenous populations have high prevalence rates, possibly related to limited economic opportunities and the location of casinos on tribal lands. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Men develop the disorder at higher rates, but the gender gap may be narrowing.  Women may gamble to cope with negative affect, while men gamble more for the thrill.  Women with the disorder are more likely to have comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders. ",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Up to half of individuals in treatment report suicidal thoughts, and about 17% report attempted suicide.  Individuals with the disorder have a 15-fold increased suicide mortality rate compared to the general population. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Gambling Disorder": "The disorder can lead to jeopardized relationships, job loss, and absenteeism from work or school.  Individuals with the disorder also have poor general health and utilize medical services at high rates. "

This develops over a short period (hours to days), fluctuates in severity, and represents a change from the individual's baseline. It is accompanied by an additional disturbance in cognition such as memory deficit, disorientation, or perceptual disturbances. There must be evidence that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or toxin exposure. Delirium should not be diagnosed in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as a coma. Perceptual disturbances, typically visual hallucinations, are common.",
        "Associated Features": "Delirium is often associated with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle, which can include daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, or a complete reversal of the night-day cycle. Emotional disturbances like anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, and euphoria are also common, with rapid and unpredictable shifts between states.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence is highest among hospitalized older individuals. In the community, prevalence is low (1%-2%). In U.S. and Finnish emergency departments, it is 8%-17% in older individuals. It occurs in up to 81% of individuals in intensive care and up to 88% of individuals with a terminal illness at the end of life.",
        "Development and Course": "Most individuals with delirium recover fully, especially if they are not elderly. However, it can progress to stupor, coma, or death if the underlying cause is untreated. In the elderly, delirium may be associated with long-term cognitive decline or major NCD. Mortality among hospitalized individuals with delirium is high, with as many as 38%-41% dying within one year of diagnosis.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Risk factors include functional impairment, preexisting cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, increasing age, illness severity, infection, depression, history of stroke, and alcohol use. Major and mild NCDs increase the risk for delirium. Older individuals are especially susceptible.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Symptoms may vary by gender, with men more commonly showing motor agitation and women more commonly showing hypoactive delirium. Male sex is a risk factor for delirium.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows generalized irregular theta slowing, but may show fast activity (e.g., in alcohol withdrawal delirium).",
        "Functional Consequences of Delirium": "Delirium is associated with increased functional decline and risk of institutional placement.

The diagnosis requires both a concern about cognitive decline from the individual or an informant, and objective evidence of substantial impairment from testing. This dual requirement helps avoid misdiagnosis in high-functioning individuals or those with poor insight. The key distinction for Major NCD is that the cognitive deficits are severe enough to interfere with independence in everyday activities, such as paying bills or managing medications.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence of NCDs increases steeply with age. Overall international prevalence for dementia (largely congruent with major NCD) is about 1%-2% at age 65 and as high as 30% by age 85. Prevalence and incidence vary cross-nationally and among ethnic and racialized groups in the U.S., with some studies finding the highest incidence in African Americans.",
        "Development and Course": "The course of NCD varies by its cause. Some types, like those from a traumatic brain injury, have a specific onset and remain static, while neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's are insidious and gradually progressive. NCDs in older individuals are often complicated by coexisting medical illnesses and frailty.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Age is the strongest risk factor for major and mild NCDs. Risk also varies by ethnoracial background, which is associated with different risks for underlying diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and social determinants of health.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Awareness and concern about neurocognitive symptoms can vary across cultures. Cultural views on whether memory loss is a normal part of aging, along with stigma, can delay diagnosis and help-seeking. Neuropsychological test norms may not be applicable to individuals with low education or those tested outside their primary language or culture.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "More women than men experience major NCD, largely due to their longer life span. Some studies suggest dementia progresses faster in women, and women tend to manifest more psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety, while men tend to show more aggression and apathy.",

        "Development and Course": "Features of a personality disorder usually become recognizable during adolescence or early adult life. While the pattern is stable over time, some types, like antisocial and borderline, tend to become less evident with age. Diagnosing a personality disorder in individuals under 18 requires that the features have been present for at least 1 year (antisocial personality disorder is an exception and cannot be diagnosed before age 18). A personality change in middle adulthood or later warrants evaluation for a medical condition or substance use disorder.",

There is considerable co-occurrence with schizoid, paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality disorders.",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits, acute discomfort with close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentric behavior. Individuals often have ideas of reference, odd beliefs or magical thinking (e.g., belief in clairvoyance or telepathy), and unusual perceptual experiences. Their speech may be odd, vague, or metaphorical, and they are often suspicious or have paranoid ideation. Their behavior or appearance is often seen as odd or eccentric, and they lack close friends. They experience excessive social anxiety that does not lessen with familiarity and is tied to paranoid fears.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder often seek treatment for associated anxiety or depression rather than the personality disorder features themselves.",

It may first appear in childhood or adolescence with features like solitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety, and peculiar thoughts.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "The disorder aggregates familially and is more common among first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia. Twin studies suggest strong genetic factors.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cognitive and perceptual distortions must be evaluated within the individual's cultural context. Beliefs in phenomena like voodoo, shamanism, or a 'sixth sense' that are part of a cultural or religious group should not be considered schizotypal.",

They may have an inflated self-appraisal and be excessively opinionated or cocky. Some display a glib, superficial charm. They are often irresponsible and exploitative in sexual relationships and as parents. They are more likely than the general population to die prematurely from natural causes and suicide.",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of antisocial personality disorder ranges from 0.6% to 3.6% in U.S. national surveys. The highest prevalence (over 70%) is found among men in substance abuse clinics and prisons.",

        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is three times as common in men as in women. Women with the disorder are more likely to have experienced sexual abuse.

They experience a markedly unstable self-image or sense of self, often feeling bad, evil, or nonexistent. They are impulsive in potentially self-damaging ways (e.g., reckless spending, unsafe sex, substance abuse)  and exhibit recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or self-mutilation. Affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate intense anger, and transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms are also characteristic.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals may undermine themselves just as a goal is about to be reached. During stress, they may develop transient psychotic-like symptoms. Premature death from suicide is a significant risk, especially with co-occurring depression or substance use disorders. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and divorce are common. A history of physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and early parental loss is more common in their childhoods.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence from U.S. national surveys ranges from 1.4% to 5.9%. It is found in about 6% of primary care settings, 10% of mental health outpatients, and 20% of psychiatric inpatients.",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder can be diagnosed in adolescents as young as 12 or 13. Prospective studies show that stable remissions are common, with impulsive symptoms remitting most quickly and affective symptoms more slowly. However, achieving full recovery with good psychosocial functioning is more difficult and less stable.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "The disorder is associated with high rates of childhood abuse and emotional neglect. It is also about five times more common among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The pattern of behavior has been identified in many settings around the world. Symptoms must be evaluated in light of cultural norms to make a valid diagnosis.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is more common among women in clinical samples, but community samples show no gender difference in prevalence, which may reflect higher help-seeking among women.",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Impulsive and antisocial behaviors are associated with increased suicide risk. About 6% of hospitalized patients with BPD died by suicide over a 24-year follow-up. Recurrent suicidal behavior is a defining characteristic of the disorder."

        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature is a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. Individuals with this disorder avoid occupational activities with significant interpersonal contact due to fears of criticism or rejection. They are unwilling to get involved with people unless they are certain of being liked and show restraint in intimate relationships for fear of being shamed or ridiculed. They are preoccupied with being criticized, feel inadequate in new situations, and view themselves as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior. They are also unusually reluctant to take personal risks because they may prove embarrassing.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals with this disorder often vigilantly appraise the movements and expressions of others and are likely to misinterpret social responses as critical. They are often described as 'shy,' 'timid,' 'lonely,' and 'isolated'. The low self-esteem and hypersensitivity to rejection lead to restricted interpersonal contacts, and they may become relatively isolated despite a desire for affection and acceptance.",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence rates from U.S. national surveys range from 2.4% to 5.2%.",
        "Development and Course": "The avoidant behavior often starts in infancy or childhood with shyness and fear of strangers. While most children outgrow shyness, those who develop this disorder may become increasingly shy during adolescence and early adulthood. There is some evidence that the disorder becomes less evident or remits with age.",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The appropriateness of diffidence and avoidance varies across cultures. Avoidant behavior may also result from problems with acculturation after migration.",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder appears to be more common in women than in men in community surveys, though the difference is small."

        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The appropriateness of dependent behaviors varies across cultures and age groups.

        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of the disorder is unknown, though it is highly unusual in women. Exhibitionistic acts are not uncommon, but the prevalence of the disorder is likely much lower. One study suggested a lifetime prevalence of 4.1% in men and 2.1% in women.",
        "Development and Course": "Adult men with the disorder often report first becoming aware of this sexual interest during adolescence.

A history of childhood sexual and emotional abuse and hypersexuality have also been suggested as risk factors."

Factors suggesting a diagnosis in child offenders include self-reported interest in children, use of child pornography, and a history of multiple, unrelated, or boy victims.",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals with the disorder may experience emotional congruence with children, preferring social interactions with them and feeling they have more in common with them than with adults. This congruence is related to both pedophilic sexual interest and the likelihood of reoffending.",

      "differential_diagnosis": "Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's-plus conditions such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Wilson's disease are distinguished from MIP by their other signs and symptoms that accompany parkinsonism. For example, Parkinson's disease is suggested by evidence of three or more cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (e.g., resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability), hyposmia, sleep disturbances such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and urinary and other autonomic symptoms common to Parkinson's disease. These features are less likely to be present in MIP. Individuals with primary neurological causes of parkinsonism are also susceptible to worsening symptoms if treated with medications causing MIP. Nonparkinsonian tremors tend to be finer (e.g., smaller amplitude) and faster (10 cycles per second) and worsen on intention (e.g., when reaching out to grab an object). With substance withdrawal, there is usually associated hyperreflexia and increased autonomic signs. In cerebellar disease, tremor worsens on intention and may be associated with nystagmus, ataxia, or scanning speech. Choreiform movements associated with tardive dyskinesia lack the steady rhythmicity of a parkinsonian tremor. Strokes and other central nervous system lesions can cause focal neurological signs or immobility from flaccid or spastic paralysis, which is characterized by decreased muscle strength and increased tone on passive movement that gives way with further pressure (i.e., clasp-knife rigidity). This contrasts with the lead-pipe rigidity and normal muscle strength in MIP. Diagnostic alternatives to MIP are also suggested by a family history of an inherited neurological condition, rapidly progressive parkinsonism not accounted for by recent psychopharmacological changes, or presence of focal neurological signs (e.g., frontal release signs, cranial nerve abnormalities, a positive Babinski sign). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome involves severe akinesia and rigidity, but also characteristic physical and laboratory findings (e.g., fever, increased creatine phosphokinase). Psychomotor slowing, inactivity, and apathy seen in major depressive disorder can be indistinguishable from the motor slowness or akinesia of MIP, but major depressive disorder is more likely to include vegetative signs (e.g., early-morning awakening), hopelessness, and despair. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, catatonia associated with schizophrenia, or mood disorders with catatonic features may also be difficult to distinguish from medication-induced akinesia. Rigidity may also manifest in psychotic disorders, delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, anxiety disorders, and functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder). In parkinsonian rigidity, resistance to passive motion is constant through the full range of motion, whereas it is inconsistent in psychiatric disorders or other neurological conditions presenting with rigidity. In general, the constellation of associated physical signs on examination and symptoms associated with the tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia of parkinsonism helps distinguish MIP-related rigidity and bradykinesia from other primary psychiatric causes of rigidity and decreased movement.",
      "comorbidity": "",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "Medication-induced parkinsonism (MIP), the second most common cause of parkinsonism after Parkinson's disease, is associated with significant morbidity, disability, and treatment nonadherence, particularly in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Because early recognition is important, any new case of parkinsonism should prompt a thorough medication history, which is essential for diagnosis of MIP. A temporal relationship between medication initiation and onset of parkinsonism should be evident. A host of agents that may be prescribed in individuals with psychiatric disorders may also induce parkinsonism, but MIP is most often seen upon exposure to antipsychotic medications that block dopamine D2 receptors. MIP occurs at higher rates with antipsychotics that have higher potency for the dopamine D2 receptor, such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone, but there are no differences in the clinical features of parkinsonism between first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Other medications that can cause MIP include calcium channel antagonists (e.g., flunarizine, cinnarizine), dopamine depleters (e.g., reserpine, tetrabenazine), antiepileptics (e.g., phenytoin, valproate, levetiracetam), antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors), lithium, chemotherapeutic drugs, and immunosuppressants. Toxins (e.g., MPTP, organophosphate pesticides, manganese, methanol, cyanide, carbon monoxide, and carbon disulfide) may also cause MIP. Usually, MIP develops a few weeks after starting or raising the dose of a medication known to cause parkinsonism or after reducing an antiparkinsonian medication. However, MIP may also develop rapidly after starting or raising the dose of a medication or have an insidious onset after many months of exposure. With antipsychotic medications or other dopamine receptor blocking agents, MIP typically develops 2-4 weeks after starting the medication and usually by 3 months. Mainly with calcium channel blockers, a second peak of symptom onset is reported after about 1 year. Because motor signs and symptoms in Parkinson's disease begin unilaterally and progress asymmetrically, the subacute onset of bilateral parkinsonism within weeks of starting an antipsychotic or other MIP-causing agent is highly suggestive for MIP. Parkinsonian signs are often symmetric in MIP, but asymmetric patterns are not uncommon and should not exclude a diagnosis of MIP. In MIP, rigidity and bradykinesia are more often present, whereas tremor is somewhat less common and may be absent. Parkinsonian tremor, also referred to as a 'pill-rolling tremor,' is a steady, rhythmic oscillatory movement (3-6 cycles per second) that is apparent at rest and is typically slower than other tremors. It may be intermittent, unilateral or bilateral, or dependent on limb position (i.e., positional tremor). The tremor may involve the limbs, head, jaw, mouth, lip ('rabbit syndrome'), or tongue. As it is present at rest, the tremor can be suppressed, especially when the individual attempts to perform a task with the tremulous limb. Parkinsonian rigidity is experienced as an involuntary stiffness and inflexibility of the muscles of the limbs, shoulders, neck, or trunk. In lead-pipe rigidity, increased tone is constant throughout range of motion. Cogwheel rigidity is thought to represent a tremor superimposed on rigidity. Bradykinesia and akinesia are observable states of decreased or absent spontaneous motor activity, respectively. There is global slowing as well as slowness in initiating and executing movements.",
        "Associated Features": "MIP is associated with increased gait dysfunction, falls, and nursing home placement. Associated behavioral symptoms may include depression and worsening of negative signs of schizophrenia. Other parkinsonian signs and symptoms include small handwriting (micrographia), reduced motor dexterity, hypophonia, decreased gag reflex, dysphagia, postural instability, reduced facial expression and blinking, and seborrhea. When parkinsonism is associated with severe decreased motor activity, medical complications of parkinsonism include contractures, bedsores, pulmonary emboli, urinary incontinence, aspiration pneumonia, weight loss, and hip fractures.",
        "Prevalence": "Reported rates of MIP are affected by absence of standard diagnostic criteria, incorrect diagnosis or misattribution of MIP signs to Lewy body disease (e.g., Parkinson's disease), or a psychiatric condition, and overall lack of recognition, especially in milder cases. It is estimated that at least 50% of outpatients receiving long-term antipsychotic treatment with typical agents develop parkinsonian signs or symptoms at some point in their course of treatment.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Consistent risk factors are female gender, older age, cognitive impairment, other concurrent neurological conditions, HIV infection, family history of Parkinson's disease, and severe psychiatric disease. MIP secondary to antipsychotic use is also reported in children. The risk of MIP is reduced if individuals are taking anticholinergic medications."

Hyperthermia (>100.4°F or >38.0°C on at least two occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as 'lead pipe' in its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the disorder. Creatine kinase elevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—manifested by tachycardia, diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation or fluctuation, urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be seen at any time. Tachypnea is common, and respiratory distress can occur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest.",
        "Prevalence": "Evidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuroleptic malignant syndrome of 0.01%-0.02% among individuals treated with antipsychotics. A population-based study conducted in Hong Kong found an incidence risk of 0.11% in individuals treated with antipsychotic medication.",
        "Development and Course": "The temporal progression of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis. Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7-10 days. The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotic medications are implicated. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most cases ; however, fatality rates of 10%-20% have been reported when the disorder is not recognized. Although many individuals do not experience a recurrence when rechallenged with antipsychotic medication, some do, especially when reinstituted soon after an episode.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual after administration of an antipsychotic medication or other dopamine receptor blocking agent. It may occur in persons without a diagnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists. Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a heightened risk include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode has been described in 15%-20% of index cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability. Nearly all antipsychotic medication and other dopamine receptor blocking agents have been associated with the syndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk. Dopamine receptor blocking agents used in medical settings (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Parenteral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been associated with increased risk ; however, the syndrome usually occurs within the therapeutic dosage range.",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Individuals may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows generalized slowing."

Tardive dystonia secondary to medication exposure does not have acute onset and may become evident when the dose of an antipsychotic medication is lowered. Other neurological conditions and endocrinopathies can also produce symptoms that resemble a medication-induced acute dystonia. Other diagnoses that mimic an acute medication-induced dystonia include anaphylaxis, tardive laryngeal dystonia, and respiratory dyskinesia.

        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential feature of medication-induced acute dystonia is sustained abnormal muscle contractions (increased muscle tone) and postures that develop in association with use of a medication known to cause acute dystonia. Any medication that blocks dopamine D2-like receptors can induce an acute dystonic reaction (ADR). Most commonly, ADRs occur after exposure to antipsychotics and antiemetic and promotility agents. Dystonic reactions most often affect head and neck muscles, but can extend to limbs or trunk. A common presentation is acute oro-mandibular dystonia involving the tongue and mouth. Involvement of ocular muscles (oculogyric crisis) manifests as involuntary forced and sustained conjugate deviations of eyes. Cervical (neck) dystonia presents as abnormal positions of the head and neck. Acute laryngeal dystonia is life-threatening, causing airway obstruction. At least 50% of individuals develop ADR signs or symptoms within 24-48 hours of starting or rapidly raising the dose of the medication, or of reducing a medication being used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. Approximately 90% of affected individuals have onset of ADRs within 5 days. The symptoms must not be better accounted for by a mental disorder or another medical condition.",
        "Associated Features": "Fear and anxiety often accompany ADRs given their intense nature and the individual's inability to control the movements. Some individuals experience pain or cramps in affected muscles. Individuals who are unaware of the possibility of developing a medication-induced dystonia can be especially distressed, increasing the likelihood of subsequent medication nonadherence.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "The risk of developing ADRs is greatest in children and in adults younger than age 40 with psychosis, with a greater incidence in males than females. Other risk factors include prior dystonic reactions and use of high-potency typical antipsychotic medications."

Dyskinesia that emerges during withdrawal from an antipsychotic may remit; if it persists for at least 4 weeks, a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia may be warranted. Tardive dyskinesia must be distinguished from other causes of dyskinesia such as Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, Sydenham's chorea, lupus, thyrotoxicosis, heavy metal poisoning, and spontaneous dyskinesias. It must also be distinguished from acute movement disorders like parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia based on the nature of the movements and their relationship to the initiation of medication.",
      "comorbidity": "",
      "full_text": {
        "Diagnostic Features": "The essential features of tardive dyskinesia are abnormal, involuntary movements of the tongue, jaw, trunk, or extremities that develop in association with the use of medications that block postsynaptic dopamine receptors. The movements are present for at least 4 weeks and may be choreiform, athetoid, or semirhythmic. Signs or symptoms develop during exposure to the agent, or within 4 weeks of withdrawal from an oral agent (or 8 weeks from a long-acting injectable). There must be a history of use of the offending agent for at least 3 months (or 1 month in individuals age 60 or older).",
        "Associated Features": "Abnormal orofacial movements are the most obvious manifestations. The symptoms tend to be worsened by stimulants, antipsychotic withdrawal, anticholinergic medications, emotional arousal, stress, and distraction. The movements are transiently reduced by relaxation and voluntary movements in affected parts and are generally absent during sleep. Dyskinesia may be suppressed temporarily by increased doses of antipsychotic medication.",
        "Prevalence": "The overall prevalence of tardive dyskinesia in individuals with long-term antipsychotic treatment ranges from 20% to 30%. Incidence in younger individuals is 3%-5% per year, while in middle-aged and elderly individuals, prevalence can be up to 50% with an incidence of 25%-30% after one year of exposure.",
        "Development and Course": "Onset of tardive dyskinesia may occur at any age and is almost always insidious. In many cases, it is objectively mild but can cause significant distress and social avoidance. In severe cases, it may be associated with medical complications like ulcers, loss of teeth, and difficulties in walking, swallowing, or breathing. When antipsychotic medications are discontinued, some individuals experience symptom improvement, but for others, it can be enduring.",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Greater cumulative amounts of antipsychotics and early development of acute extrapyramidal side effects are consistent risk factors. Mood disorders, neurological conditions, and alcohol use disorder are also risk factors. Second-generation antipsychotics have a somewhat lower incidence, but the most important risk factors are age and cumulative exposure. There is no obvious gender difference, though risk may be greater in postmenopausal women."

The tremor is a regular, rhythmic oscillation of the limbs, head, mouth, or tongue, with a frequency between 8 and 12 cycles per second. It is most easily observed when the affected body part is held in a sustained posture.",

Unlike substance withdrawal syndromes, this syndrome has no pathognomonic symptoms; they tend to be vague and variable. Symptoms typically begin 2-4 days after the last dose. For SSRIs, symptoms include dizziness, tinnitus, 'electric shock'-like sensations, insomnia, and acute anxiety. For tricyclics, discontinuation can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and rebound hypomania. This syndrome is based on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing effects of the antidepressant; drug craving does not occur.",
